<h2><a name="GREEK_EPITAPHS_AND_INSCRIPTIONS" id="GREEK_EPITAPHS_AND_INSCRIPTIONS">GREEK EPITAPHS AND INSCRIPTIONS.</a></h2>

<p class="center">Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Greece</span> was the land of poetry. Endowed with a language, of
all others adapted to every variation of feeling, from the deepest
pathos or boldest heroism, to the lightest mirth, and gifted with the
most exquisite sensibility to all the charms of poetry, it is not surprising
that her inhabitants carried it to a height beyond any thing
that the world has seen, before or since. It was intermingled with
their daily life, it formed a portion of their very being, and constituted
the chief source of their highest enjoyment. All Athens
rushed daily to the theatre, to exult or weep as the genius of the
poet directed them; and the people who could fine their greatest
tragedian for harrowing their feelings beyond endurance, must have
been differently formed from those of the present day. The well-known
saying of old Fletcher of Saltoun, is not now true; but we
can readily believe it, with such a race, when songs, like the glorious
ode of Callistratus,</p>

<p class="center">
Εν μυρτω κλαδι το ξιφος φορησω. κ. τ. λ.
</p>

<p class="noind">were daily sung, while the lyre and myrtle-branch passed from
hand to hand.</p>

<p>With the Greeks, poetry seemed to enter into the character of
every man. It was cultivated by the annual contests between its
highest professors; and the honor which awaited the victor was an
inducement to exertion of the noblest kind. It was the surest road
to the favor and patronage of the great. Not the cold and chilling
assistance which the Medici held out to the genius of their land, and
which seemed to calculate the least expense with which the credit
of a protector of learning could be bought, but the ready and regal
munificence of a man who regards the gifts of genius as the highest
with which a mortal can be favored. He who could enchant such
a people need take no care for the future. Kings disputed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
honor of his presence, and states were overjoyed to support him.
Let not the example of Homer be brought to controvert this. He
lived long before poetry thus became the delight of the people;
and, after all, to say that he 'begged his bread' is but a bold poetic
license. Beside, the eagerness with which the 'Seven Cities'
disputed for the M&oelig;onian, show what would have been his fate
had he not 'fallen on evil days.' In after ages he was honored,
and ranked all but with the gods.</p>

<p>In the same mood, the highest reward, the fullest honor, that
could be given to the rescuer of his country was to have his name
inserted in the inscription that marked the scene of his victories.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
In this spirit, no national event took place, no great battle was won,
no instance of heroic self-devotion occurred, that the genius of the
highest poets was not called upon to commemorate it in some noble
or pathetic inscription, which, in after ages, calls forth as much
admiration as the deed which originated it. The glorious death of
the three-hundred takes place at Thermopylæ; the Athenians propose
a contest for the honor of placing an inscription to mark the
spot; and crowds are gathered to adjudge the prize; for, in those
days, crowds were judges. Among the competitors are Æschylus
and Simonides; and, amid the roar of that immense multitude, the
victor-palm is awarded to Simonides, for two lines which will live
to the end of time:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ω ξειν' αγγειλον Λακεδαιμονιοις ὁτι τηδε<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Κειμεθα, τοις κεινων ῥημασι πειθομενοι.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Their noble simplicity is almost untranslatable, yet we will
attempt it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye who see this! to Lacedemon tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, honoring her sacred laws, we fell!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Or, more literally:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stranger! tell Sparta that one common grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here holds our dust, who kept the laws she gave!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The few of these majestic inscriptions which yet remain to us,
all bear the same imprint of lofty poetic feeling. Expressed with
the utmost simplicity, they would seem bald, were it not for the
skill of the poet, and the glorious associations that they call up
around us.</p>

<p>The subject of Thermopylæ appears to have been a favorite
with Simonides. Here is another which breathes the same spirit:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ει το καλως θνησκειν αρετης μερος εστι μεγιστον,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ἡμιν εκ παντων τουτ' απενειμε Τυχη·<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ἑλλαδι γαρ σπευδοντες ελευθεριαν περιθειναι<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Κειμεθ' αγηραντω χρωμενοι ευλογιη.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have endeavored to render it into the English as literally as
possible:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If to die well be Virtue's highest bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us, o'er all, the Fates have given this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fell that Greece might liberty obtain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus undying glory do we gain!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">And yet another, a glorious eulogy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Των εν Θερμοπυλαις θανοντων. κ. τ. λ.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! sacred be the memory of the brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who in Thermopylæ's deep bosom lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their country's honor! Let each hero's grave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Become an altar for the gods on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fittest praise is their unconquered death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even Time's rude hand and wasting breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those dear tombs, can snatch one wreath away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Greece delights o'er heroes still to lay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here, again, is another, from the same, beautiful in its simplicity,
on the heroes who fell in one of Greece's glorious victories;
which one is not known:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ασβεστον κλεος ὁιδε φιλη περι πατριδι θεντες<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Κυανεον θανατου αμφεβαλοντο νεφος.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ουδε τεθνασι θανοντες, επει σφ' αρετη καθυπερθεν<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Κυδαινους' αναγει δωματος εξ Αιδεω.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Undying fame for their loved native land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They won, then sank beneath Death's iron hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet, though fallen, they ne'er can die, for lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory recalls them from the shades below.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, as it was with these monuments of national glory, so was it
with the bounties of nature, the lesser tokens of love and affection,
and the humble demonstrations of piety. No fountain leaped forth
from the way-side to greet and refresh the weary traveller; no lone
tomb was raised among its grove of gloomy cypresses, that some
Meleager, some Anyte was not at hand to adorn it with a few lines,
simple indeed, but beautiful and appropriate, and which still live,
long after the names of those who called them forth have been forgotten.
Then every rustic image, erected by the peasants in honor
of some sylvan deity, was sure to have some little inscription,
graceful, and conceived in the happiest mood. Thus, in the Greek
Anthology, there are preserved nearly eight hundred epitaphs, most
of them touching from their natural and exquisite simplicity. They
generally indicate deep and quiet feeling, rarely indulging in the
little epigrammatic points that so mar the effect of almost all
modern epitaphs. What can be more beautiful than Meleager's
Lament over the grave of Heliodora?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Δακρυα σοι και νερθε δια χθονος, Ἡλιοδωρα,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Δωρουμαι, στοργας λειψανον εις Αιδαν,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Δακρυα δυσδακρυτα· πολυκλαυτω δ' επι τυμβω<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Σπενδω ναμα ποθων, μναμα φιλοφροσυνας.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Οικτρα γαρ, οικτρα φιλαν σε και εν φθιμενοις Μελεαγρος<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Αιαζω, κενεαν εις Αχεροντα χαριν.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Αι, Αι, που το ποθεινον εμοι θαλος; ἁρπασεν Αιδας,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ἁρπασεν· ακμαιον δ' ανθος εφυρε κονις.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Αλλα σε γουνουμαι, γα παντροφε, ταν πανοδυρτον<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ηρεμα σοις κολποις, ματερ, εναγκαλισαι.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This has little of the charming simplicity which usually marks
these beautiful poems, but it is an exquisite and touching lament.
We have endeavored to render it into English, although we fear</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That every touch which wooed its stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath brushed a thousand charms away.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I give, O Heliodora! tears to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, bitter tears! the relics of a love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchanged by Death. And, o'er thy sepulchre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pour this passionate flood, which shows my love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still unabated. But, 'tis vain! 'tis vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thou, adored one! art among the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boon by them unprized. Ah! lovely flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now seized by Death, I view thy silken leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All trampled in the dust. Ah! then to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O friendly Earth! I pray, that to thy bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou should'st receive her with maternal care!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the following shows the hand of genius, guided by love.
The name of its author is unfortunately unknown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ουκ εθανες, Πρωτη. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proté! thou art not dead. Thou hast but gone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To dwell in some far happier land than ours:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance thou hast the blessed islands won,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Spring eternal reigns, adorned with flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, in the Elysian Fields, thy joyous path<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is strown with opening blossoms; far above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All earthly ills, thou feelest not winter's wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor summer's heat, nor care, nor hopeless love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blest tranquillity, thy moments fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Illumed by beams from Heaven's own cloudless sky.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both of these are almost perfect, each in its own way. One
contemplates the survivor, and paints his grief at the loss of an
adored object; the other, in a more resigned mood, observes the
felicity which that object should experience in the land of spirits.
Both are somewhat wanting in the tender simplicity which is the
usual charm and characteristic of the Greek epitaph. But properly
speaking, they are not epitaphs; they are addresses to the dead.
We will give a few specimens of the inscription over the dead in
its true form.</p>

<p>Here is a beautiful one, by Lucian, on a child:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Παιδα με πενταετηρον, ακηδεα θυμον εχοντα,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Νηλειης Αιδης ἡρπασε, καλλιμαχον.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Αλλα με μη κλαιοις· και γαρ βιοτοιο μετεσχον<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Παυρον, και παυρων των βιοτοιο κακων.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While yet a tender child, the hand of Death<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deprived me, young Callimachus, of breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! mourn me not! my years were few, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Saw little of Life's care and misery.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>This one, by Erinna the Lesbian, was inscribed on the tomb of a
bride who died on the marriage night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Σταλαι και σειρηνες εμαι. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye pillars! satued syrens! and thou urn!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sad relics, that hold these my cold remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say to each traveller who may hither turn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His footsteps, whether native of these plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stranger, that within this tomb there lie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ashes of a bride; and also say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name was Lyde, of a lineage high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sad Erinna graved this o'er my clay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Callimachus, too, has given us a noble one in a single distich:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Τηδε Σαων ὁ Δικωνος Ακανθιος ἱερον ὑπνον<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Κοιμαται. θνασκειν μη λεγε τους αγαθους.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here Saon the Acanthian <em>slumbering</em> lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! say not that a virtuous man e'er <em>dies</em>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here is an exquisite little one by Tymneus, on an Egyptian
who died in Crete:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Μησοι τουτο, Φιλαινι. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grieve not, dear lost one! that thou find'st a grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Crete, far from thy native Nile's dark wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! hell's gloomy portals open wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all who seek them, upon every side.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This touching one, by Callimachus, is for the cenotaph of a friend
who was shipwrecked:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ωφελε μηδ' εγενοντο. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would that swift-winged ships had ne'er been made to cleave the billow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sopolis! we should not then deplore thy watery pillow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou liest 'neath the heaving waves, and of thee naught we claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save this poor, empty sepulchre, and thy beloved name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When a man died at sea, and his corpse was not recovered, to
receive the usual funeral honors, he was refused admittance into
Charon's boat, unless his friends erected a cenotaph and performed
the accustomed rites over it. The above appears to have been an
inscription designed for such an occasion.</p>

<p>Simonides does not forget his fire in commemorating the exploits
of a friend who fell in one of the battles against the Persians:</p>

<p class="center"><br />ON MEGISTIAS, THE SOOTHSAYER.</p>

<p class="center">Μναμα τοδε κλεινοιο. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within this tomb is famed Megistias laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bravely fell beneath the Persian's blade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where old Sperchius rolls his waters clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although his death was known unto the seer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave his Spartan chief he would not deign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, bravely fighting, 'mid the foe was slain.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>The Greeks delighted to frame epitaphs for their most distinguished
men, especially for their poets. Those in honor of
Homer are almost innumerable. Anacreon has more than a
dozen, and other favorites in proportion. We will give a specimen
of these compositions in the following beautiful lines by Simmias
the Theban, on Sophocles:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ηρεμ' ὑπερ τυμβοιο Σοφοκλεος, ηρεμα, κισσε,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ἑρπυζοις, χλοερους εκπροχεων πλοκαμους,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Και πεταλον παντη θαλλοι ῥοδου, ἡ τε φιλορρωξ<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Αμπελος, ὑγρα περιξ κληματα χευαμενη,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ἑινεκεν ευμαθιης πινυτοφρονος, ἡν ὁ μελιχρος<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ησκησεν, Μουσων αμμιγα και Χαριτων.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O verdant ivy! round the honored tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Sophocles, thy branches gently twine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There let the rose expand her vernal bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amid the clasping tendrils of the vine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he, with skill unrivalled, struck the lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the Graces, and the Aonian choir.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not less beautiful were the inscriptions affixed to fountains, rustic
statues, baths, and the hundred other little evidences of cultivated
taste so frequent in Greece. With such a people, it must have
afforded double pleasure to a wearied traveller on approaching a
fountain, sparkling in its basin of rocks, to find over it an invitation
to repose from some one of the first epigrammatists of antiquity; as,
for instance, this one of Anyte:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ξειν', ὑπο ταν πετραν τετρυμενα γυι' αναπαυσον·<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ἁδυ τοι εν χλωροις πνευμα θροει πεταλοις.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Πιδακα τ' εκ παγας ψυχρον πιε· δη γαρ ὁδιταις<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Αμπαυμ' εν θερμω καυματι τουτο φιλον.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weary stranger, sink to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath this rock's o'erhanging crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the trees their branches fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breezes soft are whispering.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freely drink these waters cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welling from yon fountain old.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sun thus fiery glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Travellers here should seek repose.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These compositions being so limited as to their subject, bear of
course much similarity to each other. We will, however, give two
or three specimens in as different styles as we can select.</p>

<p>Here is one by Leonidas of Tarentum, on a brook, too much
frequented by the flocks to be acceptable to the traveller:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Μη συ γ' επ' οιονομοιο περιπλεον ιλυος ὡδε<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Τουτο χαραδραιης θερμον, ὁδιτα', πιης·<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Αλλα μολων μαλα τυτθον ὑπερ δαμαληβοτον ακραν,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Κεισε γε παρ' κεινα ποιμενια πιτυι,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ἑυρησεις κελαρυζον ευκρηνου δια πετρης<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ναμα, Βορειαιης ψυχροτερον νιφαδος.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, traveller! taste not of this muddy fount,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In which the weary flock and herds recline,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For farther on, upon yon verdant mount,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And 'neath the branches of a lofty pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out a rock a sparkling fountain flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waters colder than the Northern snows.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, again, here are a few lines, by the fair Anyte, simple
indeed, but graceful and pleasing:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ἱζευ ἁπας ὑπο τασδε δαφνας. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Recline beneath this laurel's verdure sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And taste the waters of this crystal spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here rest thy limbs, unnerved by summer's heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Refreshed, the while, by zephyr's whispering.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet another, by an author whose name has been forgotten:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ερχεο και κατ εμαν. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, wearied traveller, here recline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath this dark o'erarching pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose waving sprays, with sighing sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy the passing winds to greet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">List to the soft and silvery sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My falling waters scatter round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its murmur, low reëchoing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repose to thee will quickly bring.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The whole has an air of quiet yet musical repose that makes us
almost fancy we hear the plashing of the falling waters.</p>

<p>There is also a pretty little inscription, somewhat Anacreontic, by
Marianus the Scholiast, on a warm spring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ταδ' ὑπο τας ρλατανους. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once Love within these shades was sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave his torch to the Naïads' keeping.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Aha!' cried they, 'we'll quench its glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within our fountain's icy flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when its cruel fires cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of man shall beat in peace.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They plunged it in, but, all untamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous torch still brightly flamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now these lovely nymphs must pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heated spring to yonder shore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here, in the compass of four lines, has Paul the Silentiary
given a better eulogy to his sea-side garden than could be comprehended
in a whole volume of modern descriptive poetry. He
allows the imagination to wander at will among objects of its own
creating, and to depict for itself the scene which he would not
describe:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ενθαδ' εριδμαινουσι, τινος πλεον επλετο χωρος,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Νυμφαι, Νηιαδες, Νηρεις, Αδρυαδες·<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ταις δε θεμιστευει μεσατη Χαρις, ουδε δικαζειν<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Οιδεν, επει ξυνιν τερψιν ὁ χωρος εχει.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here Dryads, Nymphs, and Nereids contend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, to this spot, its chief attraction lend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty, in vain, their difference would accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each to the scene such equal charms afford.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>We will now give an inscription of Theocritus, in dedicating an
humble rustic altar to Apollo:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Τα δροσοεντα τα ῥοδα. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This bushy thyme and dewy roses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are sacred to the immortal maids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dwell where Hippocrene discloses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her fount, 'mid Heliconian shades.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, Pythian Apollo! thou<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hast laurel with its dark green leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Delphi's rock, to grace thy brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of it, to thee, a tribute gives.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then on this altar, will I lay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A tender kid, with budding horns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who crops the lowest waving spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which yonder lofty pine adorns.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here are a few simple and pretty lines, inscribed by Anyte
on a statue of Venus by the sea-shore:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Κυπριδος ὁυτος ὁ χωρος. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This spot is Aphrodite's, and around<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gentle waves subdue their whitening crests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaching it from ocean's farthest bound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To give a friendly welcome to the guests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who tempt their bosom: while the neighboring sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazes upon that statue reverently.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the Greeks or Romans laid aside their arms, they would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">frequently dedicate them to some deity, and suspend them in his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">temple, with an appropriate inscription. Thus, Horace:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Nunc arma defunctumque bello<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barbiton hic paries habebit<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lævum marinæ qui veneris latus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Custodit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when any offering of this kind was made to one of the
innumerable gods of the Greeks, it appears to have been accompanied
by a few dedicatory lines. There is, of course, great sameness
in such compositions, and, in fact, they generally consist
merely of an enumeration of the articles offered, and the name of
the devotee, but we will select two or three on different subjects.</p>

<p>Here is one, by Simonides, on a spear dedicated to Jupiter:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ὁυτω τοι, μελια ταναα, ποτι κιονα μακρον<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ἡσω, Πανομφαιω Ζηνι μενους' ἱερα·<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ηδη γαρ χαλκος τε γερων, αυτη τε τετρυσαι<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Πυκνα κραδαινομενα δηιω εν Πολεμω.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Or thus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This trusty ashen spear we 'll hang above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis sacred now to Panomph&oelig;an Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arm is old which once its terrors tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent it quivering through the serried host.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>The following inscription is said to be by Plato. It was affixed to
a mirror which the celebrated Laïs, in her old age, dedicated to Venus:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ἡ σοβαρον γελασασα. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, Laïs, who, in Beauty's chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Held Greece a captive, and for whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many lovers sighed in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enchanted by my youthful bloom;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Subdued by age, this mirror true,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cythera! thus I give to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what I <em>am</em> I will not view.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And what I <em>was</em>, I ne'er can be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When a Grecian maiden arrived at womanhood, it was usual for
her to dedicate some toy of her childhood to Venus, in token of her
having abandoned her youthful occupations and amusements.
Here is an inscription, by Callimachus, designed for an occasion of
this kind. It is both graceful and elegant, yet is deficient in the
simplicity which is the usual charm of these compositions among
the Greeks. It is addressed to Venus Zephyritis:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Κογχος εγω Ζεφυριτι. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Zephyritis! I am but a shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First gift of Selenæa unto thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her nautilus, who once could sail so well<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er the unquiet bosom of the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then, if 't were ploughed by gentle, favoring gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On my own ropes I spread my mimic sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if 't were calm, I used my feet as oars<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And swiftly rowed&mdash;from which I bear my name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I was cast upon the sandy shores<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of fair lülis, and from there I came,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To be a graceful ornament to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Here in thy fane, O fair Arsinoë!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sad Alcyone will lay no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within her ocean-nest her eggs for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am lifeless. Queen of this bright shore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let Clinias's daughter hence receive from thee<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy choicest gifts. She dwells beyond the main<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where Smyrna towers o'er th' Æolian plain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would scarcely be fair to conclude this little notice of some of
the smaller gems of Greek poetry, without glancing at those
intended to be satirical or witty. Of these we can find but few
remaining, and what are thus preserved cannot induce us to regret
much the loss of those which have been destroyed. They do not
seem to show a taste as refined and delicate as is exhibited by the
other productions of the Grecian muse, and, indeed, are usually
very poor. Two or three specimens will suffice.</p>

<p>Doctors and lawyers, as at present, were favorite butts for the
shafts of the epigrammatists. The following mock-epitaph is
intended as a cut at the former. The author is unknown:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ουτ' εκλυσεν Φειδων. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas not with drugs that Phidon killed me;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He came not even near my side:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, while raging fevers thrilled me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I chanced to <em>think</em> of him&mdash;and died!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>And here is an epitaph,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A precious, tender-hearted scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of pure Simonides,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">intended, no doubt, for the grave of an enemy:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Πολλα φαγων, και πολλα πιων. κ. τ. λ</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here lies Timocreon, the Rhodian; he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved slander, drunkenness, and gluttony.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is certainly pithy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stepmothers, in those days, would seem to have been just as bad
as at present, when they have become a very proverb. Here is a
kind of epitaph by Callimachus, containing a hit at them which
certainly has no very great merit:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Στηλην μητρυιης. κ. τ. λ.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On his step-mother's tomb, this youth piously placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some flowers, that it might be properly graced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he thought, as this life had abandoned her view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her vices, no doubt, had abandoned her too.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, while he was thus standing close to the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fell, and it crushed him, Oh! terrible doom!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then youths! let this warning sink deep in your breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shun each step-mother, e'en when in Oreus she rests.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are ample, as specimens of Grecian wit, which, as here
exhibited, is certainly of no very refined or exalted description.</p>

<p>In taking a general and comprehensive glance over Greek
Epitaphs and Inscriptions, we see that they are usually characterized
by deep feeling, expressed concisely, and with the utmost
simplicity. We rarely find any catches, any evident striving after
effect, and, in consequence, to an ear not accustomed to them, they
may frequently seem meagre, and even bald. But, by studying
them, a meaning seems to grow out of the very words; and the
more that we examine them, and the oftener that we read them,
the more we find them expressive of 'thoughts that lie too deep for
words,' thoughts which can be expressed but darkly, and which,
concealed in this garb of simplicity, must be passed over by those
who are not content to pause and ponder. Whether the pleasure
derived from this be worth the labor that must be spent over them,
even though it be a labor of love, is a question which each must
answer for himself, according to his own tastes. If they lead him
to it, he will have discovered an almost inexhaustible source of pure
and elevated gratification; if not</p>

<h2><a name="MENS_CONSCIA_RECTI" id="MENS_CONSCIA_RECTI">'MENS CONSCIA RECTI.'</a></h2>

<p class="center">A CHRONICLE OF IDLEBERG.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Pelt</span>, the worthy pedagogue, whose history was suspended
in the July number of his namesake, the 'Old <span class="smcap">Knick.</span>,' was
not long in establishing for himself a fair fame in all the region
round about Idleberg; nor was his attention exclusively devoted to
the monotonous duties of his profession. While he taught the
young idea 'how to shoot,' a new and absorbing passion had taken
deep root in his own heart, and was now flourishing luxuriantly in
the genial soil. His fortunes had brought him to Idleberg, and
thrown in his path the lovely image of Ellen Van Dyke; and what
poor mortal, Yankee though he be, could resist her thousand fascinations?
Every day, at home, in the midst of her domestic duties
and her ten petticoats, she was beautiful enough, in all conscience;
but when on frequent occasions she braided her hair, and pinched
her cheeks for a bloom, and clasped around her neck that enchanting
dove of jet and gold, poor Nicholas looked and sighed, and
sighed and looked, as though his very existence depended on her
smile.</p>

<p>Could you have witnessed the eccentric movements of the fair
Ellen and the sage Nicholas, you might have guessed the nature of
their mutual feelings. How he stood by while she milked, to keep
the cow from kicking, and how the cow <em>did</em> kick, notwithstanding;
how he led the way to church, and how she followed on behind;
such smiling and blushing when they met thrice a day at table;
such an agitation of nerves whenever he clasped that small hand in
his own, that seemed just made for it; these were enough to show
that the schoolmaster's sojourn in the village was fraught with deep
interest to at least two persons more than the striplings who were
thriving on his instructions. Then when the school would be drawing
to a close, and the evening sun was growing drowsy together
with master and pupil, you might have seen the sage pedagogue
forget his official dignity so far as to smile and nod repeatedly at
some object over the way, which was no other than the cobbler's
daughter, who always happened just at that time to be taking the
air from her little gable-end window, and returned Nicholas's amorous
glances with such unequivocal symptoms of delight, as should
have made any lover's heart, if not his feet, dance for very joy.</p>

<p>But how fared the suit of Hans Keiser? Where were his organs
of sight and hearing while all Idleberg was gossiping about the
amours of Nicholas and Ellen? Hans seemed to possess the happy
faculty of contemplating, with the utmost indifference, spectacles
of youth and beauty, that would have driven many men to acts of
desperation; and but for the constant efforts of his father to remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
him that Ellen Van Dyke was living in constant expectation of
seeing him at her feet, pleading his cause with all the eloquence of
a Dutch lover, Hans would have quite forgotten the obligations of
his promise to Caleb Van Dyke. Stimulated at length by his
father's reiterated appeals and an extra tankard of beer, Hans one
evening about sunset suddenly plucked up the requisite courage,
and after arraying himself in the most glaring habiliments of his
wardrobe, started out on his pilgrimage of love. Never was lover
so tricked out with all the fascinations of dress, as was the young
Dutchman on that eventful evening. As he surveyed his enormous
shoe-buckles, glittering with the lustre of several hours' polish; his
numerous suits of breeches; his gaudy waistcoat and the broad-skirted
garment which completed his outer man; his imagination
was agreeably entertained with visions of bleeding arrows and broken
hearts, lighted halls, wedding cake, and honey-moons, all mingled
in one wild, brilliant, and enchanting panorama. Nor did this
imaginary prospect fade from his mental vision until he reached the
scene of action, and contemplated the reality with a fast breath and
a palpitating heart. Never was sanguine lover so non-plussed.
The first objects he saw at the cobbler's, were the forms of Nicholas
and Ellen sitting very close together and whispering in great apparent
delight. Cut short on the threshold of his adventure, nipped
in the very bud of his affections, Hans stumbled and stammered,
and could scarcely gain sufficient composure to bid the company
good evening, until he was reassured by Caleb, who, guessing the
object of his errand, offered him a stool and bade him be seated.</p>

<p>How many wild, bewildering thoughts scampered through poor
Hans's brain, like rats in a garret, while he sat there in silent astonishment,
listening to the suppressed whispers of the loving pair!
How heartily did he long to be away from such a place; and how
often did he think of his favorite idea of going down the river on a
flat-boat, or of his dog and gun, or rod and line, and some quiet
place in the woods or along the creeks, where woman's image had
never intruded to throw him in the shade of even a Yankee schoolmaster!
He would rather be a bar-keeper to retail beer by the
tankard, or an ostler to be be-Bob'd or be-Bill'd by every traveller,
than a lover, sitting up in fine clothes and a straight-jacket, to win
the favor of any woman under the sun, the fair Ellen not excepted.</p>

<p>Such a state of things had never entered into Hans's calculations,
and he was consequently unprepared for the emergency. Encouraged
as he had been to hope that every preliminary arrangement
had been made by old Caleb; that at the mere mention of the subject
the lovely girl would fly to his embrace; that the wedding
would come off the next week, and after that every thing would go
on in the same easy, old-fashioned way, as though nothing had happened&mdash;Hans
found the cold reality inexpressibly chilling, and
though neither a poet nor philosopher, began to think of certain
objects, such as stars and bubbles, which greater men than he had
often tried in vain to grasp. For the first time in all his life Hans
was growing sentimental&mdash;nay, desperate; and while he was wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that somebody would call in and knock the Yankee down and
then strangle him, the object of his ire arose, and after a graceful
bow to Hans, opened a door in the wall, and retired. At this the
young Dutchman breathed somewhat more freely, but still as if
laboring under great tightness of jacket, when old Caleb addressed
him, inquiring what disposition he had made of his voice.</p>

<p>Hans's only reply was a sudden start as if from the sting of an
adder, accompanied by a series of awkward gestures, during which
his face grew crimson with embarrassment.</p>

<p>'You are not frightened at Mr. Pelt, I hope, Hans?' continued
Caleb.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;no,' said Hans; 'that is&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For my part,' interposed Ellen, tossing a curl pettishly from her
forehead, 'I think Mr. Pelt a very handsome, clever young man, and
not an object to frighten boobies;' and with a single bound she
stood at the door of her chamber, and disappeared, before Hans or
her father could frame a reply.</p>

<p>'Never mind that, my boy,' said Caleb; 'that's the best sign in
the world. Cut and come again, Hans!'</p>

<p>'I tell you what, old fellow,' said Hans, rising and opening the
street-door; 'you've got this child into a tarnation scrape this time;
but if you ever catch me in these diggings again, I'll be darned!'</p>

<p>'Hans! Hans! you are a fool. Good night!' And the amiable
youth departed, and in five minutes had doffed his finery, and was
fast drowning his sorrows in the flowing bowl.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he gone, leaving Caleb ruminating on a proper scold
to be administered to Ellen the next morning, when a step was
heard in the school-master's chamber, and that worthy made his
appearance before the cobbler, bearing a great board on his shoulder.
Caleb stared for some time at the quaint characters inscribed thereon.
His eyes had for the first time that evening been opened to the
growing intimacy between his daughter and Nicholas; and he was
disposed to consider the invention as little else than a 'Yankee
notion.'</p>

<p>'And what do you call that?' he asked, gruffly.</p>

<p>'My dear Sir,' said Mr. Pelt, 'this is nothing more than a sign-board.
It is something new in town, and I think it will attract
attention, and may do you some service.' Then bringing the lamp
to bear on the board, he displayed to Caleb various devices, inscribed
on its surface, of boots and shoes of all sizes and fashions, the
whole illustrated with the words:</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">
<span class="oldenglish">Caleb Van Dyke</span>.<br />
<br />
MENS CONSCIA RECTI.
</p>
</div>

<p>'And what is it for?' asked Caleb, trying in vain to interpret the
cabalistic words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is intended, Mr. Van Dyke, to surmount your front door, to
notify the public that you are a good cobbler and an honest man;
that's all.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say, Sir, that you expect Caleb Van Dyke, after
living fifty years without any such bauble, to stick such a timber as
that over his door, to be laughed at for his pains? Why, what
would Karl Keiser say?&mdash;that old Caleb is turning Yankee in his
old age. Why, Sir, the town would burst its sides with laughter,
and the boys would throw all kinds of rocks and brickbats at it, and
the windows too. No, Sir!'</p>

<p>'Will you <em>try</em> it, my good friend,' said Nicholas, 'if it is but for a
single week? And if it does not increase your business, you may
set me down for a Yankee tinker, beside expecting me to do all the
fighting necessary to sustain the dignity of the establishment.'</p>

<p>And the result was, after a long and animated discussion, that Caleb
consented that Nicholas might nail up the board that very night, that
the town might be surprised the next morning with the suddenness
of the apparition; for such it would be considered, as it was the
only specimen of a sign-board in the village, if we except the yellow
sky and blue stars of Karl Keiser. Caleb then retired to rest
to be visited by curious dreams about sign-boards in general; and
Nicholas could scarcely sleep at all, for the busy scenes which he
imagined were already advancing in the cobbler's shop, the legitimate
result of this invention of his skill.</p>

<p>Early next morning Caleb protruded his uncombed head from the
window, and, lo! all Idleberg seemed to be gathered at his door.
His first thought was that a mob of his fellow-citizens had assembled
there for some nefarious purpose, but he was speedily reässured
at seeing Nicholas Pelt standing in the midst of the crowd, and
expounding the mysteries of the sign-board to the great delight of
his astonished audience. Men, women, and children had gathered
there from all parts of the town, with as much intensity of curiosity
as if Caleb had caught a live elephant, and was exhibiting it <em>gratis</em>.
There were men without their hats, and women without their bonnets,
and children with little else than bountiful nature had given
them. The shop-keeper was there with his yard-stick, and the
smith with his sledge-hammer; and the little French tailor was
there with his Sacre Dieu's and his red-hot goose, which he flourished
to the infinite terror of the by-standers. But the principal
figure in this motley group was no less a personage than Jonas
Jones, the rival cobbler. Mr. Jones had of late grown too large for
his trowsers. His prosperity had been too great for his little soul.
He had cut the bench in person, leaving the drudgery of the business
to the Company. By the aid of the village tailor he had
become quite an exquisite, wore white kid gloves, and occasionally
sported a Spanish cigar. There he was promenading before the
door, with an ivory-headed cane, and an ogling-glass lifted to his
eye; and every few seconds he condescended to inform the crowd
that 'he was from Bosting, and the people were a set of demd fules
to be making such a racket about a cobbler's sign.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>While curiosity was at the highest pitch, the uproar was increased
by the sudden appearance of Hans Keiser, who came swaggering
and blustering into the group, elbowing his way along until he
reached the vicinity of the school-master. He who had been so
diffident in the presence of the gentler sex, was now as bold as any
lion need be among men. Smarting with the recollection of his
recent discomfiture, he commenced addressing the assembly in a
very rude, uncouth style, denouncing the sign as a Yankee contrivance,
insinuating that the inventor was no better than he should
be, and exhorting the good citizens of Idleberg to tear down the
bauble as the only means of securing their lives and property from
the occult witchcraft which he professed to believe lay at the bottom
of it.</p>

<p>Caleb Van Dyke listened to this harangue with great attention,
for it presented the subject in a new light by appealing to his hereditary
superstitions; and it is not improbable that he would have suffered
Hans to proceed in his meditated outrage, but for the intervention
of Nicholas Pelt. Already had the sturdy young Dutchman
climbed to the board and made an effort to wrench it away, when
he was arrested by the stern voice of Nicholas, commanding him, as
he valued his life, to desist.</p>

<p>Hans threw at him a look of defiance, and informed him that if
he had the requisite physical strength, he might remove him; otherwise,
he should remain where he was until he had torn away the
board, or chose to come down of his own free will and accord.
This announcement was received by the crowd with loud bravos,
which however were immediately silenced when the school-master
deliberately approached Hans, and grasping his leg, hurled him to
the ground. Amid the flight of women and children and Mr. Jonas
Jones, who declared that in consequence of being near-sighted he
could see better from a distance, Hans scrambled to his feet, and
aimed a blow at Nicholas that might have felled a stouter man, but
for the skill with which he parried and returned it with interest.
With the generous aid of the by-standers, who were ripe for a frolic,
and expressed their anxiety on the subject by cries of 'Bravo!'
'Go it, Red-jacket!' 'Hurrah for Old Nick!' the combatants were
on the point of getting into a regular pitched battle, with the usual
adornments of bruised eyes and bleeding noses, when Caleb Van
Dyke, who had just succeeded in putting on his ten breeches, rushed
between them, and commanded them to desist. Another pacificator,
whose presence operated equally on both parties, was the fair
Ellen, who, having caught a glimpse of the fray from her window,
and entertaining an indefinite idea in the general confusion that her
father was on the point of being carried away by a press-gang,
rushed into the street before completing her toilet, and ran to her
father's side in all the beauty of her blooming cheeks and flowing
ringlets, to the admiration of the company in general, and particularly
of Mr. Jonas Jones, who, perched in safety on a barrel hard by,
reviewed the subsiding conflict, lifted his ogling-glass, and beating
his breast violently with his right hand in the region of his stomach,
exclaimed, 'My heart! my eyes! what a demd foine ge-irl!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Mean time another conspicuous object hove into sight, in the portly
person of Karl Keiser, who came ambling and waddling along, supported
by a gigantic hickory stick, to ascertain the occasion of the
unusual hubbub before the door of his friend the cobbler. The first
reply to his many inquiries revealed to him the active part his son
had taken in the fray. 'What, Hans! <em>my</em> Hans!' exclaimed the
choleric old Dutchman; 'where is the dirty dog? Let me at him!'
And brandishing his club, he made his way through the retreating
crowd, when reaching his recreant son, he belabored him lustily over
the shoulders, and pointing significantly toward home, bade him
be gone. Crouching and howling with pain, the lusty Hans obeyed;
and it may be added in parenthesis, that hearing a vague rumor
during the day that he was in request by the worshipful corporation
of the town, to answer to certain grave charges preferred against
him, by authority of the statutes against riots, routs, and unlawful
assemblies, he decamped from Idleberg, and ere long was enjoying
the long-desired luxury of going down the river on a flat-boat.</p>

<p>The pacific parties had at length triumphed over the belligerent.
The fair Ellen, suddenly conscious of her generous and imprudent
haste in rushing to her father's side, made a precipitate retreat into
the house, not, however, without having first ascertained that Nicholas
was unharmed by the fray; and in a few minutes the scene of
such recent commotion was nearly deserted, save by an occasional
school-boy who glanced at the sign-board, committed to memory the
cabalistic words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mens conscia recti</i>, and went on, repeating them at
every step. Last of all remained Mr. Jonas Jones, promenading in
solitary grandeur before the house; now watching his elegant
shadow in the sun, now glancing at the window where Ellen Van
Dyke had first appeared to his enraptured vision, now bringing his
glass to bear upon the sign, and winding up the dumb show by producing
a white cambric handkerchief, somewhat soiled by use, with
which he wiped his eyes; and looking upward and apostrophizing a
cluster of invisible stars, he placed his hand on his breast, struck
his ivory-headed cane to the ground, and walked off with an air that
would have made him illustrious even in Broadway, Chestnut, or
Tremont.</p>

<p>Never did cobbler set to work with less confidence than did Caleb
Van Dyke on that day, and never was cobbler more agreeably disappointed.
Scarce half an hour had passed, when customer after
customer came flocking in, to purchase a pair of new boots or shoes,
distinguished by the original name of men's conscia recti. Never
was cobbler so complimented for his work: such capital leather!
such elegant stitches! such a capacity for making large feet small,
and small feet large! that every man who shod himself anew,
declared that Caleb had at length discovered the true philosophy of
cobbling. Conscious as Caleb was that the very articles now so highly
commended, were manufactured months previous, and had been
lying by in want of purchasers, he was forced to attribute this sudden
change in his fortunes to the magical effect of the sign-board.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
That was a proud day for Nicholas Pelt. All this time he had been
reviewing from his loop-hole the busy scenes enacting at the cobbler's,
and when school was over, he hastened into the street in
advance of his eager pupils, and rushed to the cobbler's, where he
was met at the door by Caleb in a high glee, jingling the genuine
coin in both pockets, and declaring that he had realized more profit
during that single day than in the entire month preceding.</p>

<p>This seemed a prosperous tide in Caleb's fortunes. Cheerfulness
again lighted up his countenance, and competence and independence
seemed the sure and early rewards of his toil. Successful industry
never threw a brighter glow around any fire-side than was felt at
the humble hearth of the honest cobbler. Caleb was growing so
good-humored and facetious, had purchased of late so many dainties
from the village store, that the dame and the children were <em>not</em>
overwhelmed with astonishment, as they should have been, when
one morning at breakfast the old gentleman informed them that he
was going to devote that day to shopping, and would take them all
with him. Such piles of calicoes, cloths, and muslins, as the busy
mercer threw down on the counter with an air that said he didn't
mind it&mdash;he was quite used to it&mdash;he could put them all up again
in five minutes; such trinkets, toys, and fineries as were then and
there displayed, the little urchins had never dreamed of seeing,
much less of wearing. And then the old gentleman bought so
much and so fast that the clerk, a youth with a sleek head, and a
pen behind each ear and one in his fingers, was kept quite busy
noting them down. There was a new bonnet for the dame, and a
new dress and a 'pink-red' shawl for Ellen, and a hat for Rip, and
a doll for the baby, and trowsers and jackets for a dozen more, and
stuff for a bran new suit for Caleb, to be converted into fashionable
shapes by that arch knight of the shears, the little French tailor.
And then you should have seen them at church the next Sunday;
how the dame sported her new bonnet, and how Ellen sported <em>her</em>
new shawl, and how Rip kept trying on his new hat right in the face
of the minister, and how young old Caleb looked in his new suit;
and how the neighbors all stared at them, and Nicholas Pelt chuckled
in one corner, and the minister preached to them about vanity, fine
clothes, and all that! ah, that was fine, and it all came from that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mens conscia recti!</i> No fear of poverty there; no dowdy hats nor
ragged breeches, taxing the needle and the patience of the dame;
no thought of casting Ellen into the embraces of such a graceless
scamp as Hans Keiser. All these thoughts and a thousand more
passed rapidly through the cobbler's mind; and when he remembered
the kindness of the school-master, he did not hesitate to forget
his old prejudices, so far as to admit that a Yankee might be
both a gentleman and a scholar.</p>

<p>While the honest Dutchman was thus inhaling the breezes of
good fortune, his rivals, Jonas Jones and Company, were fast sinking
into obscurity. The exquisite individual whose name gave title
and dignity to the firm, was fairly smitten, as we have seen, with
the charms of Ellen Van Dyke. For several weeks he devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
himself to all the external blandishments his fancy could invent to
arrest the affections of his rival's daughter. These had failed, and
worse still, his customers were dropping off, one by one; his supplies
were suffering under a collapse. Mr. Jonas Jones soon grew
crest-fallen. His elegant form and fascinating attire ceased to be
visible on the public walks, as of yore when fortune smiled. His
wit had ceased to sparkle like champagne; his wares no longer
dazzled the credulous Idlebergers with their cheapness and durability.
Adversity had driven him to the bench, where he sat day
after day, waxing his ends, brooding over his reverses; now dreaming
of Ellen Van Dyke, and now moralizing on the vanity of earthly
things in general. Mr. Jonas Jones was evidently in a decline.</p>

<p>While Mr. Jones was sitting one day in this happy frame of mind,
tugging very hard at a most obdurate piece of leather, his reflections
were suddenly interspersed with a series of original ideas. Unable
to compete with his rival, he would call on him immediately, and
offer his services as a copartner in his business and a husband for
his daughter. Animated by these conceptions, Mr. Jones leaped
from his sitting posture with a degree of activity that astonished the
Company, threw aside the cumbersome rigging peculiar to his craft,
devoted a few minutes to his toilet, and with hasty strides started
out on his errand of love and copartnership. By one of those fantastic
freaks which Fancy sometimes plays, his first step on the
pavement was arrested by a new thought which flashed through his
mind, and suffused his weazen face with smiles; and turning on his
heel, he reëntered the shop, and walked deliberately into a private
apartment, where he remained for several days on the plea of pressing
and important business, secluded from the observation even of
the Company. He had procured an immense board, and a great pot
of black paint; and that was all they knew.</p>

<p>Sailing under a fair sky, with the wind all astern, and his canvass
swelling in the breeze, Caleb Van Dyke was little prepared for the
clouds that so soon lowered above his head. Early one morning,
when on the point of resuming his daily toil, he glanced carelessly
up the street, and beheld a great crowd before the Yankee's door,
staring at a gigantic sign-board inscribed in quaint characters:</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center"><span class="oldenglish">Jonas Jones and Company</span>.<br />
<br />
MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CONSCIA RECTI.</p>
</div>

<p>Adjusting his spectacles to reassure him that he was not dreaming,
and muttering something very dreadful to think of, he called the
school-master from the breakfast table, and directed his attention to
the rival sign-board.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' said Nicholas; 'nobody but a Yankee would ever
have thought of that. They are very bright over there; they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
translated a Latin inscription into English in a manner truly original.
I confess I never thought of <em>that</em> before; we will see, however;
we will see.' And Nicholas went off in a brown study to his
school-room.</p>

<p>Caleb Van Dyke had good cause that day to know that the population
of Idleberg was as vacillating as an aspen-leaf, or any thing
else that may be shaken by a breath. Not a single customer called
that day, nor the next, nor the next. In addition to the crowds of
male customers who thronged Mr. Jones's establishment, he saw
numbers of the other sex on a similar errand, who were curious to
see that particular fashion of shoe called 'women's conscia recti.'
Mean time Nicholas Pelt was very grave, and spent all his leisure
time in his chamber; and at the end of a week, during which
Caleb's shop had been entirely deserted, Nicholas had the satisfaction
of showing to his host a sign-board larger, longer, and more
imposing than all the rest, inscribed:</p>

<p class="center">
MEN'S, WOMEN'S, AND CHILDREN'S CONSCIA RECTI.
</p>

<p>It is needless farther to pursue the ebb and flow of popular favor
between the rival cobblers. Suffice it to say that this last device
succeeded to the entire satisfaction of <em>our</em> cobbler; and men, women,
and children, literally flocked to his shop, until his hands were kept
busy night and day, and his pockets overflowed with gold, silver,
and bank-notes. Yankee had met Yankee in the conflict of intellect,
and fortune had smiled upon the school-master. In a very
short time Mr. Jonas Jones and Company pulled up their stakes,
moved farther west, and were never heard of afterward.</p>

<p>What now interposed to prevent the union of Nicholas and Ellen?
How readily the fond father said: 'Yes, certainly, Mr. Pelt. God
bless you! I can never repay your kindness.' How beautifully
Ellen blushed at the thought that she was actually going to be married;
how the parson tied the knot which no enactment of man
should ever sunder; how friends gathered there to congratulate the
happy pair, and share the bountiful repast prepared by the dame;
how the wit of the bridegroom and the beauty of the bride never
shone so brightly as then, and how Rip was put to bed of a surfeit;
and how through it all the story of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mens conscia recti</i> was
repeated over and over in tones of merriment, until the cobbler's
dwelling rang again; these pictures are all too bright for delineation
by our feeble pen.</p>

<p>Departing from the well-beaten paths of many writers of legends
and chronicles, who usually drop the curtain at the bridal night, we
ask but a moment, gentle reader, to record in outline the incidents
which grew out of and succeeded this alliance. These weddings,
after all, are actual occurrences, and not dreams of romance. Night
<em>will</em> slowly retire; the lamps must necessarily go out, even though
filled with the oil of Aladdin's; the liveliest tongues will get tired
of talking, and the briskest feet of dancing; and then the quiet
honeymoon will succeed, and life with its stern realities will wake
the loving pair to the thought of duties and pleasures yet in store,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
until the fading twilight of existence shall restore the bright ideal
of 'Love's young dream.'</p>

<p>Nicholas's first step, then, was to inform Caleb Van Dyke that
beside being a school-master, he was also a very respectable cobbler;
and Caleb was convinced of this fact, almost against his will,
at the sight of a pair of sturdy shoes manufactured by the quondam
pedagogue, with a neatness and despatch that truly astonished him.
Having arrived at the conclusion that the Idlebergers were disposed
to spend their money more freely on their feet than their heads,
Nicholas delivered his pedestal and birchen-rods to another adventurer
who came along soon after in search of a school, and betook
himself to cobbling in all its varieties. The firm of Van Dyke and
Pelt thrived beyond precedent, and the old sign-board, after having
become so illustrious, was permitted to retire, and its place was soon
filled by another, composed and executed by the gifted Yankee, as
follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Blow, blow, ye winds and breezes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All among the leaves and treeses:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing, oh sing, ye heavenly muses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we make both boots and shoeses.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the mean time Hans Keiser returned to Idleberg, thoroughly
cured of his passion for adventure. His old father, while under the
combined effects of those genial stimulants, beer and tobacco,
received him with great cordiality. Hans soon became reconciled
to the loss of Ellen Van Dyke, having found a congenial spirit in
the person of a farmer's buxom daughter, who had been for years
selling butter, eggs, and poultry, at the sign of the yellow sky and
blue stars, until the young Dutchman was suddenly smitten with
her charms; and all parties consenting, they were in due time pronounced
man and wife by the very parson who had officiated at the
nuptials of Nicholas and Ellen.</p>

<p>Since then Idleberg has emerged from the ashes of its primitive
obscurity, and has risen into great consideration at home, if not
abroad, for its chaste attractions and its elegant society. The spot
of ground once occupied by the hostelry of Karl Keiser, now sustains
an imposing mansion-house, distinguished hereabouts as the
Indian Queen Hotel. During Caleb Van Dyke's life-time nothing
could induce the old gentleman to improve the indifferent dwelling
to which a long residence had so much attached him; but Nicholas
took the earliest advantage of his decease to remove the old shop,
and rear upon its ruins a larger and more elegant building. While
the Pelts are enjoying the luxuries of elegant country-seats and
well-tilled acres, they cherish a commendable pride in remembering
the humble means by which they have arisen to competence.
Nicholas and Ellen are now enjoying a green old age, surrounded
by their numerous and prosperous posterity; and the old family carriage,
as it comes rumbling into town every Sunday, drawn by a
pair of sterling gray horses, has painted on the pannel of each door
an odd-looking pair of shoes of the last century's fashion, beneath
which are inscribed in antique characters, the magical words:</p>

<h2><a name="THE_POLYGON_PAPERS" id="THE_POLYGON_PAPERS">THE POLYGON PAPERS.</a></h2>

<h3>NUMBER TEN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Authors</span> are very unequal. The loftiest sometimes sink lower
than the mediocre ever do; the passionate are often lifeless; and
the deep and original portrayer of character and the heart frequently
utters sententious truisms and apophthegmatic nonsense. I have
lately been perusing the writings of La Bruyere, and have been
forced more than ever to admire his masterly choice of language,
his vivid wit, and keen discrimination. Among some very acute
and just remarks I observed one so amazingly juiceless, that for a
time I thought it must have been hazarded as a kind of tantalizing
puzzle&mdash;a hollow nut for fools to crack in the hope of finding a
kernel. He says, 'As we become more and more attached to those
who benefit us, so we conceive a violent hatred for those who have
greatly injured us'&mdash;that is, 'we love our friends and hate our
enemies!!' A truly profound conclusion, and one requiring long
experience and deep philosophy to discover! My efforts to detect
<em>some</em> brilliant thread in the triteness, and <em>some</em> savor in the jejuneness
of the above childish enunciation, gave rise to the following
'scatterings' on aphorisms, etc., and their writers.</p>

<p>Proverbs have been called 'the condensed wisdom of nations.'
They may, I think, with more propriety be entitled 'an epitome of
the truths and falsehoods contained in the more extended forms of
books, and in the practical commentary of life.' Those of them
which are true, are like the rules in the practical sciences, which
the most ignorant artisan may apply, although he know nothing of
the principles on which they are based, or of the process by which
they are proved. If all these adages were true, they would prove
of infinite advantage in life; since by a slight effort of the memory
we might retain rules for our guidance through almost every difficulty
of doubt or of temptation. But the misfortune is that here, as
elsewhere, the true is mingled with the false, and only excellent
sense with an addition of long experience can inform us which are
worthy and which unworthy of reception. Now this same good
sense and experience would furnish us with the same wisdom by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the induction of our own minds, and thereby supersede the necessity
of the written or oral maxims of others. Hence it is clear that
proverbs are of little practical utility, since the very wisdom they
would teach is a prerequisite to an intelligent adoption of their
teachings. Their chief value lies in their conveying a great deal of
instruction in a portable form, and presenting it very impressively
by the energy of some brief and homely illustration.</p>

<p>The frequent use of aphorisms and proverbial phrases has in all
ages been regarded as a vulgarism. Many of them are strikingly
true and extremely elegant, having emanated from thoughtful and
polished minds; yet in their daily use among writers and speakers
of all classes, they become soiled and worn, familiar and profane.
They acquire the tone of cant, and are resigned to the possession of
those who cannot think and speak for themselves. In the fragments
of the old Greek comedy and in others of their familiar
writers, we find proverbs usually given up to the subordinate characters.
Even in Euripides, 'the philosopher of the scenes,' nearly
all whose personages harangue in sententious monostichs like disputants
in the Academus or declaimers from the Stoa, the proverbial
style is mostly left to messengers and attendants, pedagogues and
nurses. Among the Romans, Plautus is most profuse in adages,
and with him they drop, thick and fast, from the mouths of pimps
and parasites, courtesans, and slaves. Horace employs them seldom,
save when personating some humble character; and Cicero,
even in his 'Familiar Letters,' often prefaces their introduction by
an apologetic 'ut aiunt'&mdash;'as they say.' Every one, who has
read (and who has <em>not</em> read?) the romance of the renowned Cid
Hamet Benengeli, remembers the ludicrous distress suffered by the
knight of La Mancha in hearing his squire discharge whole broadsides
of rustic proverbs at all times and on all subjects. The
Italian language overflows with these trite familiarities. The low
characters in the early English comedies, and the old English
writers in general, abound in these homely texts, which teach the
rustic moralist to <em>live</em>. If the novelists of this age of gas and
steam-boats place in the mouths of their subaltern heroes few of the
thread-bare aphorisms so common in the works of Smollet and
Fielding, it is because the 'ignobility' of the present day have
arrived at great perfection in a peculiar dialect&mdash;a compound of
buffoonery and sentiment, of poetry and flash. In place of the
quaint proverbs and worn allusions, in which their ancestors couched
their humble thoughts, they bedizen their every-day attire of flimsy
cant and coarse burlesque with borrowed flowers of fancy and the
stolen jewelry of wit.</p>

<p>Writers of apophthegms, maxims, laconisms, etc., are more liable
to errors than most other authors. Their aim is to be striking rather
than consistent; and hence, in their pages you may frequently find
sentiments of the most conflicting tendency. They have conceived
a truth, and in order to illustrate it more forcibly, they clinch it with
a brilliant catch; that is, they sharpen it with a glittering nothing,
or point it with a sparkling lie. They fall into the same category<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with the epigrammatists of the Martial school, who often bore you
with a long and irrelevant preface for the purpose of introducing a
smart turn at the conclusion. How infinitely inferior, by the way,
with all their wit and all their polish, are the sharp conceits and
coquettish affectations of Martial and his successors to the severe
and noble simplicity of the Greek epigram! An ingenious thought
is commonly a false one. Its very ingenuity and uncommonness
are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> evidence that it is neither natural nor correct. The
apophthegmatist perceives that a particular fact is frequently associated
with another fact. He immediately notes it down, and in a
shape of antithetic brevity delivers it to others as a universal guide.</p>

<p>Many of these maxims are like those of Rochefoucault, on which
Bulwer and some other self-imagined dissectors of the heart appear
to have looked with an envious emulation. They are hard, cold,
and brilliant&mdash;the deductions of a long, active, and passive experience
in scenes of courtly treachery and polished heartlessness.
They are gems, that have crystallized by an infusion of selfishness
in the residuum of exhausted feeling&mdash;sparkling stalactites, formed
by continual drippings from the cells of an acute and scheming
brain upon the bottom of a cavernous and icy heart. If true at all,
they are true, thank God, only among the summits of social life,
where the scintillations of loveless intellect flash from peak to peak
through an atmosphere of frosty splendor. Even if they be better
founded and more widely applicable than I believe, their spirit is
baleful, their tendency pernicious. They sow in the warm heart
of youth the suspicions of the hackneyed worldling, and teach him
that to meet and baffle the simulations and dissimulations of his
fellows, he must sheathe his innocent spirit in the panoply of craft,
subject every movement to the guidance of consummate art, and
conceal every generous impulse and each warm emotion beneath
the ice of unchanging coldness, or behind the glittering veil of one
inscrutable, invincible, and everlasting smile. Asserting the absolute
wickedness of all men, and impressing the necessity of a sleepless
and universal doubt, they inoculate the tender nurslings of a
rising generation with that poisonous wisdom which diffuses a
moral death through the pithless trunk and leafless branches of their
riper years. When I hear one rehearsing these odious lessons, and
affirming that Virtue lives not in the heart of man, I am not so
much convinced of her non-existence in the world as I am of her
non-residence in the bosom of her slanderer. Whether the upholders
of this infamous doctrine find in their own breasts the prototype
of the unmitigated moral deformity which they attribute to their
race, I shall not attempt to decide. But it is certain that these
degraders of humanity are reduced to this dilemma. They either
have an internal consciousness of their own utter depravity, which
induces them to think all others equally devoid of worth, or from
the evidence of history and experience they infer that mankind are
entirely abandoned-devils incarnate. If the first be the basis of
their belief, they must indeed be wicked&mdash;wicked beyond hope,
and beyond redemption; for even thieves, cheats, and impostors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
proceed on the conviction that there is something good, honest, and
unsuspecting in the human breast. If they draw the foul tenet and
utter the blasphemous libel from testimony and experience, how
poorly must they have read the volume of history, how blindly have
moved on the theatre of life, not to have seen that humanity is a
mixture of good and evil, and that its eventful records are often
bright with kindness, and faithfulness, and every virtue, though
oftener alas! black with cruelty, and treachery, and crime! Leave,
dear youth, leave 'Timon of Athens' and all others, who have outlived,
or fooled away their capacities of enjoyment, to gnash their
toothless rage at a world they have abused, and, believe me, you
may find on the written and unwritten page of human action a
thousand deeds of noblest daring and most unswerving love&mdash;deeds
whose touching moral beauty will thrill through all your frame,
causing your eyes to glisten, your flesh to quiver, and your heart to
swell.</p>

<p>The aphorisms of Epictetus, Antoninus, Seneca, and others of
that class are not, indeed, of the same heartless and freezing character
with those of Rochefoucault, and the Chesterfieldian school;
yet they are mostly of too Stoical and superhuman a cast to be of
much practical benefit to poor human nature. They counsel you,
for instance, to bear the gout with patience, by considering that
many have had it before you, have it now, and will have it after
you; that impatience will not ease your pain; that your were born
for suffering and must expect to suffer, and that, at the worst, it
cannot last for ever. All mighty, true, and philosophical, no doubt;
but the twinged and wincing sufferer cannot extract one grain of
comfort from any of these considerations but the last. Sometimes
they bid you reflect whether your sorrows are not the consequences
of your own crime or folly. The affusion of <em>this</em> 'oil of consolation'
is literally the casting of oil upon the fire. It is a sedative for
grief resembling a handful of red-pepper thrown into inflamed eyes.
It is adding to the agonies of the previous torture the rage of
remorse and the bitterness of self-contempt.</p>

<p>These calm and rational exhortations to 'take it coolly,' and
'never to cry for spilled milk,' are all very good till they are needed.
They are extremely salutary before the fever kindles or the milk is
spilled; but in the presence of pain, or on the advent of disaster,
to all but those who are gifted with fortitude by nature, or have
been disciplined in the school of affliction, they are about as effectual
as whistling in the teeth of a nor'wester. Their utter impotence
in the storm of passion reminds me of the directions given by
a good New-England deacon to his choleric son. 'Whenever you
feel your <em>dander</em> rising,' said he, 'be sure to say the Lord's prayer,
my son, or else the alphabet clean through; and long before you git
to the eend on't, you'll be as cool as a cucumber, or an iceberg.
Promise me faithfully, my son.' 'Yes, daddy, I promise.' Off
trudged Jonathan to school, carrying his bread and meat with a
small bottle of molasses in his jacket-pocket, and his late firm
promise uppermost in his mind. A boy, who bore him an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
grudge, met him, and, after calling him the 'young deacon,' and
many other scurrilous nicknames, caught him off his guard, and
threw him to the ground, tearing his jacket, and breaking his
molasses-bottle. Now it <em>is</em> said by censorious Southrons, that a
Yankee will take a great many hard names with the patience of a
martyr: his spirit is word-proof; but tear his clothes or cheat his
belly, and he will fight 'to the knife.' Up jumped Jonathan, his
eyes wolfish and his lips white with rage. But 'there was an oath
in Heaven,' and he did not forget it. So he proceeded to swallow
his alphabetical pills&mdash;an antidote to wrath, not mentioned in the
'Regimen Salernitanum,' nor recognized by the British College.
'A, B, C,&mdash;you've tored my jacket&mdash;D, E, F,&mdash;you've spilt my
'lasses&mdash;G, H, I, J, K,&mdash;you're a 'tarnal rascal&mdash;L, M, N, O, P,
Q,&mdash;I'll larn you better manners, you scamp, you!&mdash;R, S, T,
U, V,&mdash;I'll spile your picter, you old wall-eye!&mdash;W, X, Y, Z, <i>ampersand</i>&mdash;now
I'll pound your insides out o' you, you darned nigger!'
And with that, Jonathan, whose passion had been mounting
alphabetically throughout all his father's prescription of vowels and
consonants, caught the young scape-grace, and, throwing him down,
was proceeding to work off each of the deacon's twenty-six anti-irascible
pills in the shape of a dozen hearty fisticuffs, which might,
perhaps, have brought the poor fellow to the omega of his days had
not the timely approach of a passenger interrupted the manipulations.
So much for rules to control the passions.</p>

<p>The Greek pentameters, containing the 'Admonitions of Theognis
the Megarian' form one of the strangest compositions I ever
read. They are as complete a medley as any <i>colluvies</i> of vegetables,
shells, and bones, swept by the Noachic flood into the hollows
of the earth. Here a petrified rose-leaf rests its cheek upon a
nettle; here lies the bill of a dove, and here a shark's tooth; here
is the grinning chasm of a lion's jaws, and here the skeleton of a
loving lamb. A kindly maxim is followed by a cynic snarl, and
exhortations to universal affection sleep side by side with counsels
to entire distrust in man. They are probably the 'disjecta membra'&mdash;a
pest on the pedantry of Latin!&mdash;the scattered limbs of
several moralists, and in their present incoherency, they remind one
of that anomalous species of union facetiously styled by grammarians,
a '<em>con</em>junction <em>dis</em>junctive!'</p>

<p>The proverbs of Solomon, apart from their inspiration, are of
clearer and more comprehensive wisdom than all the par&oelig;mial
precepts of the world beside. But among them, as Peter said of
the writings of his brother Paul, there are 'some things hard to be
understood.' As one instance out of many, I refer to Prov. xxvi.
4, 5. 'Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
like unto him;' and again, 'Answer a fool according to his folly, lest
he be wise in his own conceit'&mdash;directions which it requires the
wit of an &OElig;dipus fully to explain, and the wisdom of Solomon
himself to act out with appropriate discrimination.</p>

<p>Among all modern books of that cast, I prefer the 'Lacon' of the
eccentric Colton. Straggling through the fields of life after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Greek and Roman reapers, he has bound his gleanings into a bundle
scarce inferior to their sheaves in beauty and abundance. If
hardly equal to some of his Gallic rivals in glitter and acuteness,
neither has he dazzled the eyes of Truth with sparkling falsehoods,
nor pierced the heart of Virtue with the darts of slander, nor sundered
with the sword of sarcasm the fresh-strung nerves of Hope.
Expressing thoughts at once noble, original, and true, in words
always happy, and in a style at times of almost unrivalled elegance,
the teachings of his few brief pages are of more value than all the
tawdry sentiment and flimsy ethics scattered through the fifty 'parvum
in multo' volumes of the <i>Last</i> of the <i>Baronets</i>.</p>

<p>'Dans toutes les conditions,' says La Bruyere, 'le pauvre est bien
proche de l'homme de bien, et l'opulent n'estquère éloigné de la
friponnerie. Le savoir-faire et l'habilité ne mènent pas jusq 'aux
énormes richesses.' How shallow and how false! One can hardly
imagine how a man of his wit and sense could have ventured the
sweeping declaration, that poverty is a proof of honesty, and wealth
of knavery. Every one must see in the world around him that
riches fall exclusively neither to the good nor to the bad, but somewhat
according to the industry of men, and still more by the
caprices of Fortune, or, in better language, by the mysterious dispensations
of Heaven. Many of the rich have acquired their
wealth by discreet and honest industry, and manage it with a
thoughtful and wise benevolence. Many of the poor, on the contrary,
are niggards on a contracted scale, and in their avidity for
money would engage in any knavery to obtain it. Why have they
not become rich? Because they had neither industry, enterprise,
nor patience, and many constantly laid out their little gains in
extravagant dress, temporary pleasures, and vicious indulgence. If,
then, we grant the eager love of money to be a vice, the poor are
often chargeable with it to the same extent as the rich, while the
sum of their moral excellence being still farther lessened by idleness,
impatience, imbecility, and vice, they are left far inferior to
the wealthy in the scale of character and value. The truth is, the
larger portion of mankind are dishonest, so far as temptation urges,
and their courage or their opportunities allow. It is also true that
large numbers of the rich have amassed their fortunes by knavery
or gross injustice, and that a majority of them have occasionally
infringed the rules of rigid honesty. And it is certainly no less true
that, in some shape or other, a large plurality of the poor are more
or less unjust and knavish in their little dealings with each other.
The proportion of truly upright men is doubtless greater among the
poor than among the rich, because riches have confessedly a corrupting
influence upon the heart. But this corrupting influence of
wealth has nothing to do with the mode of its acquisition. The
ranks of the rich are constantly recruited from the crowds of the
poor, and most of those who are now rolling in wealth were at first
but penniless and friendless boys. If, therefore, a majority of the
poor be radically and truly honest, so are an almost equal number
of the rich, who are taken indiscriminately from among the poor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Furthermore, the position that the opulent have generally gained
their money unfairly, clashes with two other very orthodox and
ancient proverbs, that 'villany never prospers,' and that 'honesty is
the best policy.' I leave those who guide themselves by old saws
to reconcile these contradictions, and independently of all proverbs
I form my own opinion; which is, that riches and power are distributed
among men with little or no respect of merit, and that
fraud, however beneficial temporarily and in a coarse, pecuniary
view, is ruinous, if we regard the sum total of our existence.</p>

<p>There are many opinions so commonly entertained and so frequently
expressed, that although they have not perhaps attained
the fixed form of an adage, yet they have the operation, and may
be considered in the light, of proverbs. These opinions may be
divided into two classes&mdash;generalities in general, and generalities
in particular. The first arise from men's observing a few instances
of a given fact, and erecting these instances into an all-embracing
rule. They consist in such unqualified assertions as these&mdash;'Americans
are money-worshippers: Frenchmen are fops: religionists are
hypocrites: doctors are pretenders: lawyers are knaves: politicians
are time-servers. These may be termed generalities in general,
and they generally amount to falsehoods in particular. Unqualified
assertions are usually qualified lies; for every thing in this world is
a commixture of good and evil. What is good at one time, is bad
at another; or what is good in itself is bad from its circumstances
and adjuncts, or bad in comparison with something better. He,
therefore, who affirms a tiling to be good or bad absolutely, entirely,
and at all times, commonly affirms more than is true, or, in other
words, affirms a restricted falsehood.</p>

<p>Generalities in particular are derivative generalities, and the
detection of their falsity requires a double analysis. After generalities
in general have been established by a course of false reasoning,
generalities in particular are inferred by a process of similar
sophistry reversed, and an unfair deduction from an unsound
predicate derives specific falsehoods from a generical untruth.
Like that famous tree of the Indies, whose branches droop downward
to the ground, and take root, and rise again, and descend once
more, and rise afresh, till the central trunk is guarded by a youthful
forest, and clings to its native earth by a thousand vegetable arms;
so one of these comprehensive untruths sends forth its ramifications
of mistake, which spring upward in a fresh growth of reproductive
errors, till they are all fastened to the soil of the social mind by
numberless and ineradicable roots, and the parent falsehood stands,
surrounded by a giant progeny of lies. Here is the reasoning.
Such a class of men are bad in general; <em>therefore</em>, this particular
individual is worthless. Lawyers are usually dishonest men; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>,
this individual lawyer is a knave.' Here is the same beautiful logic
reversed. 'I have heard of <em>some</em> cruel slave-holders; <em>therefore</em>,
every slave-holder is a bloody tyrant. I have seen <em>some</em> haughty
and oppressive 'millionaires;' <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>, all the opulent are purse-proud
and unfeeling aristocrats.' These are the foolish generalities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
opinion and assertion, which have caused so many misunderstandings,
suspicions, antipathies, and heart-burnings among the classes
of society, the sects of religion, and the nations of men. He who
should believe in the infallibility, and guide himself by the directions,
of accredited opinions, and undisputed proverbs, would often,
be wofully puzzled by their divergent counsels and contradictory
assertions. They often uphold as unfailing truths things that are
true but in a majority or even a measureless minority of instances,
and that according to extraneous contingencies.</p>

<p>For example, in speaking of heirs they represent them as universally
a race of spendthrifts. Now they may, or may not, be so,
according to their peculiar dispositions. Doubtless the acquisition
of wealth by inheritance is less calculated to impress its possessor
with a prudent estimate of its value than its accumulation by 'eating
the bread of carefulness.' Yet thousands of legatees are more
miserly than their legators, and thousands more manage their inheritances
with discreet liberality.</p>

<p>It is said that intemperance <em>always</em> hardens the heart. Far be it
from me to play the sophist in favor of excess, or to deny its natural
<em>tendency</em> to blunt the feelings, and brutalize the soul. But, though
I know not how it is, I have <em>seen</em> many, who, amid the ruins of their
character and the withering of their hopes, seemed only to grow the
more tender, generous, and self-sacrificing, and while shrinking
from the coldness of their connections and the contempt of the
world, overflowed with affection toward all mankind. A few years
since I chanced to sit by the death-bed of one, who had drank up a
fine estate, and brought down his once full and muscular form to a
shrunken, fleshless frame&mdash;a very skeleton. That man would, at
any time, have periled his life for another; and, when in his cups,
would have rushed on inevitable death for the meanest of his kind.
And even then, as he lay now writhing in pain, now fainting with
feebleness, forgetful of his own sufferings and danger, he followed
all my motions with his eyes, constantly beckoned to the servants
to attend to my wants, and watched me, stranger as I was, with an
anxious tenderness, which almost choked me with tears. Peace be
with thee, poor Ned! May the earth rest lighter on thy heart than
did the scorn of thy kindred! The adamantine chains of habit
bound thee to degradation, and dragged thee to the grave&mdash;but a
truer and kinder spirit never dwelt within a human breast!</p>

<p>A common maxim is, that 'old maids' are peevish, tea-drinking,
scandal-loving bodies. Many old maids are so; for their constant
exposure to unfeeling derision renders them the first; sympathy
with each other's condition gives them the second habit; and the
weakness of human nature prompts them to envy and detract from
those whom they deem more fortunate than themselves. But there
are many of these slandered sisters who never coveted the double
blessedness they are supposed to envy; who are too independent to
sigh for gilded compliments and hollow homage; and are quite content
to live in isolated virtue, and die in solitary peace. Yes!
thousands of these unappropriated 'units' have been mellowed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the touch of Time, till they have become the very models of
womanhood; modest and intelligent, just and generous, mild and
charitable; aiding by their labors, consoling by their words, enlightening
by their wisdom, and instructing by the beautiful teachings
of uniform example. Hannah More is at the head of the female
world.</p>

<p>It is a frequent remark that the sons of eminent men are rarely
eminent. Now eminence is rare in <em>every</em> class of society&mdash;for it is
a relative term, meaning <em>uncommon</em> excellence, and of course, it
cannot be very common. But I think the proportion at least as
large among the offspring of the great as among the children of the
obscure. If among the former, vice too often consumes the energies
of the spirit, and parasites persuade them that greatness is the
privilege of their birth, and that Elisha will receive the mantle,
although he walk not in the footsteps of Elijah; to the latter 'the
ample page of Knowledge' has been sealed by stern necessity, and
'Penury has frozen the genial current of the soul.' Not one in
ten thousand among the sons of the humble has ever attained to
eminence, and quite as great a percentage is found among the
children of the distinguished. The opinion, therefore, is either
false, or is a stupid truism amounting to this: 'Few of the multitude
distinguish themselves by <em>uncommon</em> merit.'</p>

<p>Another common assertion is, that the sons of very good men are
generally more profligate than those of others. This proverb contradicts
another adage, that a 'good tree bears good fruit,' and they
nullify each other. In truth, however, the latter maxim is true,
agreeing with reason, and verified by experience; while the former
is absurd in theory, and false in fact. It forgets the grand principle
of cause and effect. It were, indeed, a strange and mournful comment
on the perverseness of our race, if the pious counsels and
pure example of an upright father only served to harden and
degrade the child. Strange were it, most strange and sad, did the
seeds of a blameless life fail generally of their natural crop, and
fructify only in acts of guilt and shame. On this theory, the tender
parent, who would take the surest course for securing the integrity
and welfare of his offspring, should in his own person display an
obscene drama of flagitious action, and, like the lawgivers of Sparta,
infuse in others a disgust of vice by a practical exhibition of her
foulness. I do not thus believe in the force of contrast, or the
power of opposites to beget and produce each other. The ordinary
rule of Nature is, 'Like produces like.' The quite common opinion
that reverses this rule in reference to the children of pious parents,
arose from the observation of some instances of sad degeneracy,
and as these were very striking, people forgot the mass of instances
on the other side of the question, and generalized a few scattering
exceptions into a universal rule.</p>

<p>Once more. Many modern novelists, when they wish to be very
novel and acute, exclaim (in some suitable context) 'Misery loves
company.' 'Ho! ho! are you there, old Truepenny!' 'Misery loves
company.' And, pray, my fine apoththegmatist, are you deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
original in this remark? Is it a profound discovery, or is it a shallow
truism? Are you very wise, or quite otherwise? 'Misery loves company.'
And doesn't joy love company? Does not anger long to
diffuse its fires, confidence to reveal its hopes, and triumph to announce
its exultations? Instead of appearing to say something when
you were saying nothing, why did you not remark in unpretending
prose that we are sociable, sympathy-craving beings, and love company,
whether miserable or happy; and that all our passions, save
the morose ones, seek for participation? If you wished to go a little
father, and assert a truth, which should not be very brilliant, nor
entirely unfathomable, you might remark, that if ever our joy or our
sorrow fly from crowds, it is only because it is unfitted for their
sympathy or too great for their comprehension. When our happiness
or grief is so intense that it fills all the heart and engages all
the brain, we withdraw ourselves from all communion, and reverize
in the selfishness of solitude and silence.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_QUOD_CORRESPONDENCE" id="THE_QUOD_CORRESPONDENCE">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish">Harry Harson.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER ELEVENTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pacing</span> up and down the small room, and muttering to himself in
broken sentences, with his brows knit, at one time hugging his arms
tight to his breast, at another flinging them over his head, snapping
his fingers, or rubbing his hands together, and chuckling to himself,
in that low, mocking tone which was peculiar to him, Rust spent
the short interval that elapsed between the departure and return of
Kornicker.</p>

<p>When he came to the office on that afternoon, and discovered the
character of the persons who during his absence had made it their
haunt, his first impulse had been to rid himself of them in the most
summary manner; nor would he have hesitated to have done so but
for the fear that Kornicker might regard such a proceeding as tantamount
to taking the same step toward himself, and might break
with him immediately, when he could but illy spare him. Determining,
however, to reap some advantage from his situation, he set
to work during the dinner to effect two objects; the first of which,
being to quell the spirits of his clerk, was completely successful;
but in the second, which was to discover something against Kornicker
by which he might hold not only that gentleman's actions but
his conscience in check, and finally break him down, until he became
a mere machine, to obey blindly whatever was dictated to him, he
failed utterly. Nothing was discovered on which he could hang a
menace; no burglary, no swindling, no embezzlement, no fraud;
not even a petty contemptible theft; nothing that could subject him
to fine or imprisonment, even for a single day; for Kornicker, though
a vagabond of the first water, still stood out stoutly for principles;
of which he had established a code to suit himself, somewhat peculiar
in character, but which carried him along more safely, and with
less to answer for, here and hereafter, than many who boast a nicer
creed; and to whom God has granted greater gifts and more
extended opportunities. Rust had mistaken his man. Kornicker
never deserted a friend in trouble; his hand was never tight shut
against the solicitations of others, even though that hand might contain
but a shilling; and often and often, the whine of a beggar had
drawn his last copper from him, when he knew not whither to turn
for another. Rust, however, was not daunted; for he believed no
man so immaculate but that at some time or other he had brought
himself within reach of the iron arm of the law. 'Patience,
patience!' thought he; 'time will bring that too, and then he will
be mine; all mine!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>His revery, and these thoughts which formed a very essential part
of it, were cut short by the arrival of the subject of them, followed
by the small boy who had officiated as waiter, bearing a large basket;
and who, according to the established usage of all waiters, on
entering a room which they intend to quit at any period on the same
day, left the door open to facilitate such proceeding.</p>

<p>'Shut the door!' said Rust, sharply.</p>

<p>The boy obeyed the order instantly; and as was intended, the
stern, abrupt tone in which it was spoken had a very decided effect
upon Kornicker, who slunk into a seat, near the window, and began
to look abstractedly at the ceiling.</p>

<p>'It's growing dark,' said Rust, turning to him. 'Will you oblige
me by lighting a candle?'</p>

<p>There was a show of civility in the wording of this request; but
the tone and manner were as peremptory as in his abrupt order to
the boy; and it was obeyed with such nervous alacrity that Kornicker
succeeded not only in fulfilling it, but in burning his own finger;
whereupon he placed the candle on the mantel-piece, and blew
upon the afflicted member with great vociferation.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Rust, his thin lip curling, 'it's a pity; especially as
it's entirely gratuitous. I asked you to light the candle, not your
finger.'</p>

<p>Kornicker stopped abruptly, and probably somewhat stimulated
by the pain, advanced a step toward him; and looking him steadily
in the face, said: 'Thunder! man; let me tell you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' interrupted Rust, bowing with his hand on his heart,
and his eyes closed, with an expression of profound humility, 'tell
me whatever you please; I shall be delighted to obtain information
of any kind. Michael Rust is always in search of knowledge,
<em>Pray</em> go on with your communication. From its opening I should
think that it was on the subject of atmospheric electricity; though
perhaps it may treat of burns, or candles, or even of dinner parties
for four; or of the various modes of keeping promises; or perhaps
you intend to show some new process by which a dinner contract
for one may be made to include five. The world's improving; perhaps
mathematical calculations are advancing also, and I may be
behind the age. But no matter; whatever it is, emanating from
such a source as Mr. Kornicker, Mr. Edward Kornicker, it must be
valuable. Go on, Edward. My <em>dear</em> Edward; <em>do</em> go on. Bless
me! how slow you are!'</p>

<p>Kornicker, completely staggered by the list of topics which Rust
enumerated, each of which was foreign to what he had to say, and
each of which suggested something disagreeable, stared at him for
a moment or two in sore perplexity; and then, instead of continuing
his remarks, merely shook his head, muttered something between
his teeth about 'a hard horse to ride,' and finding that blowing had
not assuaged the pain of his finger, had recourse to the other usual
remedy; and putting it in his mouth, sucked it apparently with
much satisfaction.</p>

<p>'You do not proceed,' said Rust, after waiting with an air of profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
attention; 'I'm sorry, <em>very</em> sorry; for I've no doubt that we've
lost much. You shouldn't have been diffident; you had quite a
small audience; only two; one of them a boy, and the other an old
fool, you know; and we would have made all allowance for youthful
embarrassment.'</p>

<p>Kornicker, however, had so completely altered his mind that he
made no other response than that of drawing his finger from his
mouth, with a sudden noise like the popping of a cork out of a bottle;
and holding it to the light, examined it with an air of anxious
and sympathizing investigation; as if saying to it, 'Never mind, old
finger; don't let his remarks trouble you. <em>I</em>'m your friend. I'll
stand by you;' which, doubtless, he intended to do, and did. Having
concluded his examination, and his mental assurances of devotion
to his afflicted member, he took a seat at the window, and
looked out in the darkness. Rust in the mean time continued his
remarks in the same strain; but as he went on Mr. Kornicker began
to show signs of restiveness; shaking his head in a sudden and
positive manner, as if giving a sharp negative to some imaginary
request; drawing in his breath between his teeth, with a whistling
sound, and snuffing with extraordinary frequency and vehemence.</p>

<p>'A pleasant prospect that! The view from the window is very
picturesque, particularly by candle-light,' said Rust, whose eye had
not been off his clerk for a moment. 'I think it embraces a broken
window and an old hat; although you may not be able to see them
in this light, as they are at least ten feet off. I hope you enjoy it.'</p>

<p>'Suppose I do?' said Kornicker, turning short round, placing a
fist on each knee, and looking up at Rust with an eye brimming
with dogged sulkiness; 'and suppose I don't; what then? what
concern is that of yours? I came here to do your work; not to give
an account of my thoughts or tastes.'</p>

<p>'Right! <em>very</em> right!' replied Rust, who saw that he had pushed
matters as far as was prudent; and that any farther direct attempt
at annoyance, might result in open rebellion upon the part of his
clerk; but at the same time it was no part of his policy to appear to
yield to this angry expostulation; so he merely repeated what he
had just said: 'Very, <em>very</em> right, Mr. Kornicker; so you <em>do</em> my work,
I care not a straw for your thoughts or tastes; and I <em>have</em> work for
you, of which I will speak to you presently.'</p>

<p>Turning to the boy, who was removing the things from the table
and placing them in a large basket, he asked: 'Were you acquainted
with the persons who dined here to-day?'</p>

<p>The boy, who at that moment was invisible with the exception of
a rear view of his legs, and of that portion of his body to which
they were immediately attached, the rest of his person being busy at
the bottom of the basket, in a struggle with the remnants of the roast
beef, rose slowly to an upright attitude, and turning round, somewhat
red in the face, asked if Rust was speaking to him; and on
being answered in the affirmative, and the question being repeated,
he nodded, and said: 'He rather thought he ought to be, and
shouldn't be surprised to find out that he was, if waitin' on 'em, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
once, nor twice, nor three times, nor four times, was one of the
avenues to their acquaintance.'</p>

<p>'Then you <em>do</em> know them?' said Rust, to whom this reply was
rather enigmatical.</p>

<p>'In course I do; all to pieces!' replied the boy.</p>

<p>This whole sentence, from the look and gesture which accompanied
it, Rust took to be a strong affirmative.</p>

<p>'Who are they?'</p>

<p>'Ax <em>him</em>;' replied the boy, indicating Kornicker by a nod of his
head. 'But don't <em>you</em> know? My eyes! I thought you know'd
'em all. If I didn't I'm bu'st!'</p>

<p>Having given utterance to this elegant expression, he forthwith
plunged into the basket, and, with the exception of his aforesaid
legs, was seen no more, until Rust told him 'to be quick,' when he
again emerged, with a piece of meat in his mouth; and shouldering
the basket, staggered out of the room, telling Rust 'that if he didn't
shut the door himself this time, he suspected it would be left open;
as he had but one pair of hands, and that pair was full.'</p>

<p>While these words were passing between Rust and the boy, Kornicker
sat in the window in silence; but ever and anon, turning
about and fastening his eye on the feet of his employer, he slowly
perused him from his toes to the crown of his head; and then
revised him downward to his feet, with an unflinching stare, generally
pausing at the eyes, with an expression by no means amiable;
and concluding his examination by a shake of the head,
accompanied by that same drawing in of the breath already
described.</p>

<p>In truth, Kornicker was gradually beginning to entertain the idea
of throwing himself bodily upon Rust; of pummelling and mauling
him, until he was a jelly; of flinging him promiscuously under the
table, to keep company with the blacking-brushes, and a ragged
coverlet which lay there, being part of Mr. Kornicker's sleeping
establishment; then of rushing into the street, cutting his employer,
throwing himself into the arms of his absent friends, and of setting
up for himself, from that time forth. As these dim resolutions
acquired strength, he began to straighten himself, look Rust full in
the face, finger his snuff-box with vast nonchalance, indulge a low
whistle, and once or twice he even worked his arms and shoulders
backward and forward, as if tugging at an imaginary oar, or as if for
the purpose of developing his strength, for some unusual performance.</p>

<p>These and various other indications of a resuscitation of spirits
did not escape the quick eye of Rust, who saw that he could venture
no farther; and after standing for some time with his arms
folded, and his eyes fastened on the floor, he turned to Kornicker
and said, in a tone very different from any which he had hitherto
assumed:</p>

<p>'I have appeared to you to act strangely to-night, eh?'</p>

<p>'D&mdash;&mdash;d if you hav'n't!' replied that gentleman, laconically.</p>

<p>'I supposed so,' said Rust; 'but I came here harassed, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cornered; as a wild beast would seek his den, for quiet and repose;
and to endeavor to extricate myself from troubles which are thick
upon me; and I found it the resort of&mdash;what?'</p>

<p>He paused and looked at Kornicker, who not knowing exactly
under what head to class the individuals who had passed the afternoon
there, remained perfectly silent.</p>

<p>'It was not right.' said Rust. 'It was not right; but no matter
for that now. I have work on hand which must be attended to at
once. Bring your chair to the table.'</p>

<p>Kornicker in compliance with this request, and not a little mollified
by Rust's change of manner, dragged his chair to the place
designated, swung it to its feet, sat himself down on it, and leaning
his elbow on the table and his cheek on his hand, waited for the
other to open his communication.</p>

<p>Taking a large pocket-book from his pocket, Rust ran his eye
over a number of papers which were folded up in it, and finally
selected two, which he placed on the table in front of him.</p>

<p>'There they are, at last. Those are the ones;' said he, pushing
them toward Kornicker.</p>

<p>The clerk took them up one after the other, holding an end in
each hand, and carefully viewed them from side to side; after which
he replaced them on the table, and observed, partly by way of
remark and partly in soliloquy: 'Two promissory notes; Enoch
Grosket maker; in favor of Ezra Ikes, for fifteen hundred dollars
each; due six months ago.'</p>

<p>'And indorsed by Ikes, to Michael Rust;' continued Rust, taking
up the phrase where Kornicker had left off. 'Indorsed to Michael
Rust; that's me!' said Rust, looking eagerly in his eyes, and pressing
his thin finger on his own breast: 'me&mdash;me&mdash;me!'</p>

<p>'If you tell me that by way of news, you're late in the day,
man;' replied the other. 'I know that Michael Rust is you, and
that you are Michael Rust; I think I ought to.' And for the first
time in the course of that evening, Kornicker closed his eyes, and
shook inwardly; thereby indicating that he was enjoying a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>'You will take these notes,' said Rust, without paying any regard
either to his merriment or his observation, 'and sue on them at
once; arrest Grosket, fling him into prison, and there let him lie and
rot, until his stubborn heart be broken; until he crawl to my very
feet and lick the dust from them. Ho! ho! would that he were
there now, that I might spurn him! If he will not bend, why then,'
muttered he, setting his teeth, and his black eye dilating, 'let him
<em>die;</em> his blood be upon his own head. The fool! the vain, weak,
short-sighted fool! He knew not that I had these in my grasp,'
said he, taking up the notes and shaking them as if in menace at
the object of his wrath. 'Now let him writhe in his den; and moan,
and rave, and blaspheme to the walls that shut him in. There is no
escape; no means of borrowing three thousand dollars. No, no;
the jail is his home; the felon his room-mate; ho! ho! What a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
glorious thing law is! Now then, Enoch, <em>friend</em> Enoch! <em>conscientious</em>
Enoch! we'll see in whose hand the game lies!'</p>

<p>There is always something in the display of any fierce emotion,
no matter how subdued may be the manner or tone it assumes, so
it be connected with stern, unflinching purpose, that quells all lighter
feelings in others; and there was that in the glowing eye of Rust,
and in the convulsive working of his thin features, and in the sharp,
hissing tones of his voice, although he spoke scarcely above a whisper,
which effectually banished from Kornicker all farther inclination
for merriment; but at the same time he felt no great complacency
in being in the employ of a man who kept such dark and bitter
feelings garnered up in his heart.</p>

<p>'Is it Enoch Grosket, the one who used to be here, you want put
in limbo?' inquired he, after looking in the face which bent over
his, for nearly a minute; 'why, I thought&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<em>Think</em> what you please,' replied Rust, fiercely. 'I explain my
motives to none. My instructions to you are simple. Get the
money for these notes from Enoch Grosket, down to the last farthing.
Listen to no offers of compromise; and whatever law will
do toward adding wretchedness to poverty, let him feel!'</p>

<p>Rust spoke sternly and peremptorily, too much so for his own
purpose; for he observed that Kornicker eyed him with a look of
suspicion, and once or twice shook his head, as if the duty prescribed
did not suit his taste. He saw that he must play his cards nicely;
and to allay any feeling of compunction which might be gaining
ground with Kornicker, he said, as if speaking to himself: 'Much
as that man Grosket has wronged me; much as he has threatened
me; anxious as he now is to ruin me; I'll deal more fairly with him
than he has done with me. I'll be open in all my dealings. I'll
not stab in the dark, as he has done. He shall know who his opponent
is; and let him cope with him if he can.' 'Mr. Kornicker,'
said he, addressing his clerk, as if unconscious that what he had
just said had reached that gentleman's ear, 'be strict in conducting
that matter with Grosket; but deal fairly with him. Let every proceeding
be such as will bear the light; no quirking, nor quibbling;
no double-dealing; no, no. Give him law; law, only law; that's
all I ask. I'll not let anger sway my actions, whatever effect it may
have on my words. Did I not step in between him and starvation?
Did I not lift himself and his family from the very dirt; and for five
long years did I not furnish the very bread which they ate; and
what then? The viper turned upon me and stung me. Notwithstanding
all this, Mr. Kornicker, I now ask only justice. Other men
might be revengeful, and might long for his very life; but it's not
so with me; oh no! no! Michael Rust seeks only justice, only law.
Now, Sir, what's the first step you'll take upon those papers?' said
he, pointing to the notes; 'how will you arrest him?'</p>

<p>Kornicker threw himself back in his chair, and putting his fingers
together at the points, and forming two hollows of his hands, looked
at them with an air of profound deliberation, as if selecting one out
of several hundred modes of commencing a suit. Having, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
supposed, duly impressed Rust with the importance of the undertaking,
he took his snuff-box from his pocket, and having balanced
it for some minutes, in great absence of mind, in one hand, while
with equal abstraction he held a pinch of snuff between the thumb
and forefinger of the other, he replied, 'that he thought, upon the
whole, it would be advisable to commence by 'capias;'' after which
he snuffed copiously.</p>

<p>'How soon can you begin?' inquired Rust.</p>

<p>'As soon as I can get a writ,' replied Kornicker, dusting the particles
of snuff from his prominent feature with the back of his hand.
'A blank costs two cents.'</p>

<p>'Begin at once; to-night;' said Rust, pushing a handful of silver
to him. 'Have him in prison before midnight. Spare no expense,
but carry out my views.'</p>

<p>'Why, you <em>are</em> quick, upon the trigger,' replied his clerk. 'I can
fill up the writ at once; but it's eight o'clock; the clerk's office is
shut, and we can't get a seal; so is the sheriff's office, and we can't
get a deputy. It won't do. We must wait until to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Time is gold, now,' muttered Rust, starting up and going to the
window, against which he leaned his head, whilst his eyes peered
out in the gloom. 'Had I been warned sooner; had that love-sick
boy spoken but a few hours earlier, I might have had him in my
grasp. While I am here, with my hands tied by the empty forms
of courts and legal proceedings, Grosket, who laughs at them all, is
at work. Who knows what a single night may bring forth! In a
single night, nay, in a single hour, the schemes of a whole life have
been overthrown; and with such a man as Grosket to cope with,
the danger is doubled. <em>Would</em> that I had him here! with no law to
hold up its warning finger at me; with my gripe upon his throat!
ho! ho! ho! Good Enoch! my dear, best-beloved Enoch! would
that I had you here! So nothing can be done until to-morrow?'
said he, abruptly, turning to Kornicker, as he recollected that he was
not alone; 'and I must sit here, shackled, until then?'</p>

<p>'As to the shackles,' Mr. Kornicker replied, 'that he knew nothing
about them; but as to issuing the writ before morning, it couldn't
be done, that was plump!' Saying which, he pushed back the
money, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, whistled thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'You'll be here early in the morning?' said Rust.</p>

<p>'I rather think I will,' replied Kornicker, 'unless the house should
take fire, in which case I shall withdraw.'</p>

<p>Rust looked at him for an explanation, which Kornicker immediately
gave by pointing to the coverlet under the table, and informing
him that they were then in his bed-chamber; at the same time
volunteering the information that during the day the bed itself was
placed in a spare room in the garret, occupied only by a cat and her
family; which said cat and family were a source of much annoyance
to him, from their being addicted to sleeping on his bed during
the whole time that it was not occupied for the same purpose by
himself. 'Cats hadn't fleas; there was some comfort in that. If it
had been a dog and family, he should have resisted strenuously.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Rust, at the conclusion of his observations, turning to him, merely
said: 'If nothing can be done here, I must be at work where my
time will not be lost. I shall expect you to be ready early in the
morning. Good night!'</p>

<p>At an early hour on the following day Mr. Kornicker sallied out
of his office, and bent his steps toward the City Hall, bearing in his
hand a small slip of printed paper, whereby the Sheriff of the City
and County of New-York, was commanded by the People of the
State of New-York, to take the body of Enoch Grosket, defendant,
if he should be found in his bailiwick, and him to safely keep, and
to have him before the Judges of the Supreme Court, on a certain
day and at a certain place, to answer unto Michael Rust, plaintiff,
for the non-performance of certain promises and undertakings, etc.,
to the damage of the said plaintiff of three thousand dollars. And
on the back of the same paper was a small memorandum, containing
a hint to the said sheriff to hold the defendant to bail in six
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Thus armed and equipped according to law, Mr. Kornicker presented
himself at the sanctum of that officer. It was a small room,
with a partition a few feet high thrown across it, to shield the sanctity
of the magistrate, and his deputies from contaminating contact
with the rabble members of the bar. Behind this partition was a
sloping desk, on which lay a number of large ledgers; and looking
over one of these, stood a stoutish man, with a round, full face, thin
whiskers, and an aquiline nose. He had a gold chain hanging over
his vest, and there was not a little pretension in the cut of his garments.
As Mr. Kornicker entered, he put his pen in his mouth,
paused in his employment, and looked at him over the partition.</p>

<p>'Here's a gentleman whose flint wants fixing,' said Kornicker,
handing him the writ. 'I want it done at once. Screw him tight.'</p>

<p>The man nodded; and taking the paper, after glancing at it,
turned to a person who sat behind the partition, invisible to Kornicker,
and said: 'Mr. Chicken, can't you do this?'</p>

<p>Mr. Chicken rose up; a mild man, six feet high, surmounted by a
broad-brimmed hat, from beneath which straggled a few locks of
hair, which had once been iron gray, but which were now fast verging
toward white. His nose was bulbous, being neither Roman nor
pug; his eyes dark, and paternal in their expression; his neck was
buried in the folds of a white cravat; and in his hand he carried a
cane, probably for the combined purposes of self-aid and self-defence.</p>

<p>Fixing his hat more securely on his head, and placing his cane
under his arm, he drew from his pocket a small leathern case, containing
his spectacles; and having placed them on his nose, and
adjusted and readjusted them several times, he proceeded to peruse
the document submitted to his inspection. Having completed this,
he gently inquired if Grosket lived a great way off; and being
informed that he did not, he said, 'he rather thought he'd like the
job.' This conclusion having been happily reached, the man with a
Roman nose entered the writ in one of the ledgers which lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
front of him, after which Mr. Chicken placed it in a large pocket, in
company with about a dozen documents of the same description,
and looking affectionately at his collection, he shook his head with
a melancholy smile, and said:</p>

<p>'Folks is beginning to talk of abolishing imprisonment for debt.
It's an innovation as will bring no good; and it's the hardest-hearted
proceeding agin us deputies as has been done yet. It'll use us all
up. Forty year I've been a deputy, and never heerd of the like of
it afore; never! never! Arter this, rascals will be gentlemen, and
deputies will be beggars! Ah!'</p>


<h3>CHAPTER TWELFTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A sad</span> blow, was this quarrel between her father and Ned
Somers, to Kate Rhoneland; for so fierce and bitter was the anger
of the old man, whenever he was alluded to, and so opprobrious
were the epithets which he showered upon him, that at last his
name was never mentioned between them. But had Kate forgotten
him? or had she forgotten the day on which he had accidentally
met her in the street, and had turned about, and walked at her
side; and had, among other things, casually told her that he loved
her more than all the world beside? Or had she forgotten how she,
in the same casual manner, had uttered a few words in reply; but
how, or what they were, she knew not; except that they made his
eyes grow bright with smiles, as he whispered in her ear, that she
was 'his own dear little Kate, and had made him very happy;' and
that they had loitered on, hour after hour, quite forgetting that she
had any where to go, or any thing to do, or any thing to speak of,
or think of; or that there was any one else in the wide world but
themselves? No, no. Kate had forgotten none of these things. A
happy day was that! They talked over occurrences which had
taken place long before. They explained away trifling difficulties,
and misunderstandings, which had been the source of much thought
and anxiety to both; and which (although Kate did not confess
thus much) had often caused her eyes to fill with tears, when she
was alone, and there were none to see her; and which accounted
for the bright drops which her father had sometimes discovered on
her cheek as she lay asleep, when he came to take a last look at
her, at night; and which had caused him to ponder and dream until
he forgot them amid his own troubles. Thus was that day spent;
a green spot in memory. Through quiet, out-of-the-way streets,
they took their way; through quarters which the bustle of the world
never reached, and where the rumbling of the city was heard only
in the distance, like the hum of a mighty hive; beneath tall trees
with their long branches drooping to the earth, as if to protect the
soil which made them so great and beautiful as they were; and
their deep green leaves, now glittering with sunlight, now dark in
shadow, hanging motionless, or quivering on their slender stems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with a scarcely audible sound, as if whispering to each other; and
through the thick foliage were glimpses of the blue sky, with here
and there a fleecy cloud loitering on its broad bosom, like a sail at
sea; while beneath, the earth was checkered with a mosaic of light
and shadow. Who can tell the happiness of those young hearts
on that day! Who can tell why sky and earth seemed so beautiful;
and even the faded old houses about them, pent up in dim streets
with great trees nodding over them like dozing sentinels, seemed
to wear a gay, glad look?</p>

<p>How much they had to say! And yet when it was said, and they
had parted, and Kate was recalling it to mind in her own room,
how little there was in it! How familiarly she had leaned on his
arm, as if she had known him from childhood! and how fondly he
looked down in her face! and how strange it seemed to call him
Ned, whom she had never before addressed except as Mr. Somers.
Yet, 'Ned' sounded better. Much better than 'Mr. Somers;' and so
did 'Kate,' than 'Miss Rhoneland.' Poor little Kate! There was
much food for thought in all that had passed that day; much food
for happy thought. All that had occurred was dreamed over; and
never had time flown by so rapidly. How surprised she had been,
on hearing a clock striking the hour, to discover that he and she had
been walking together for four long hours, and that Ned, like a
downright-vagabond, as he was, and as she told him that he was,
had contrived (she of course not being aware of the matter) to get
her at the longest possible distance from home; so that, when they
returned it took them a good hour to get back; nor did he even
then, as she shrewdly suspected, select the most direct course; but
as she was not certain on this point, she said nothing about it; but
merely told him, 'that she would be careful the next time she
trusted herself to his guidance;' which no doubt she was.</p>

<p>Well! the happiest day in our lives must have an end; and that
day, which certainly was the happiest one in the life even of Kate,
who, up to that time, had had little to make life other than a bright
dream, at last came to an end; or at least the time which most contributed
to make it all that it was, was past, and Ned Somers was
gone, having escorted her to the door and even into the entry, from
which, however, he retreated with some precipitancy on discovering
that he had inadvertently, for the first time in his life, pressed
his lips to hers, and that if he remained there, the same inadvertent
offence might be repeated to an indefinite extent; an occurrence
which, of course, under present circumstances, could not fail to be
in the highest degree lacerating to the feelings of both.</p>

<p>She never spoke to her father about what Ned had said; for Ned
had told her that he did not wish to ask her of him until he could
look him in the face, and tell him 'that he could support her as she
always had been accustomed to be supported; and that it was his
daughter, and only his daughter, that he asked.' He told her, too,
that that time would come soon, and that they were both young, (for
Kate was then barely sixteen,) and Kate had said, 'Oh yes, entirely
too young to get married,' although Somers had differed from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
on that score; but from that day forth, Ned had constantly been at
the house at all hours, until he was regarded as one of themselves,
and grew to be almost as great a favorite with the old man as with
Kate herself; and both looked hopefully forward to the time when
Ned's prospects, which were already brightening fast, should be
firmly established, without anticipating obstacles of any kind from
Rhoneland.</p>

<p>Things had gone on thus until Michael Rust came; and with
him came a change in all else. There was evidently something
between him and Rhoneland, hidden from all others, which had a
powerful influence upon the latter, who more than once spoke to
Kate of the great wealth of their new guest, inculcating upon her
respect and deference to him. At other times the old man spoke to
her of observing a strict economy; of saving every farthing, to lay
it up in case of need, speaking of gold as if it were omnipotent;
and seeming to gloat over it with a miser's hunger; yet such had
never been his disposition until Michael Rust came. But that was
not all; for, although it would almost have broken her heart to see
the fine-soul'd old man, which her father always had been, sinking
down into a mere machine for hoarding dollars, with no other
instinct or aim in life; it was not that, however, which lay heaviest
at her heart. From what had dropped from him at intervals, she
knew that there was a stronger bond between him and Rust than
the mere obsequiousness which avarice pays to wealth. There
was the quick, restless motion of the body when Rust's name was
mentioned; the watchful, irresolute glance of the eye when he
was present; ever ready to detect his slightest movement, like the
look of a person ever in fear, and ever on his guard against attack.
There was the nervous, anxious desire to propitiate, to anticipate
any thing which he might desire; to remove any thing which might
give offence; and unaccompanied by any of those tokens of good-will
which indicate that these acts spring from the heart and not
from the fears; all showing that whatever tie might connect them,
it was not that of love on the part of Rhoneland.</p>

<p>At last Rust, who for a long time had troubled himself about
none but Rhoneland, seemed to discover that he had a daughter,
and that that daughter was exceedingly beautiful, and that the old
man doted on her. He also discovered that a certain young man
by the name of Edward Somers came to the house frequently;
much more frequently than was proper for a young man not connected
with the family, and not desirous of being connected with
it; and not having any thing in particular to bring him there, as
Ned certainly did not say that he had. Having made this discovery,
and thinking it desirable to get Somers out of the way, he set
to work to attack his character, not openly, but in that most assassin-like
of all modes, by throwing out mysterious innuendoes; by occasional
whispers in the ear of old Rhoneland, and by repeating rumors
which he had heard; but which of course he did not believe, and
which he mentioned only that his friend Jacob might know what
absurd stories were afloat. They were never repeated, however, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the presence of Kate, but only to the old man when he and Rust
were alone; Rhoneland, however, stood out stoutly for his young
friend. He said, 'that he had seen much of him, and never any
thing amiss; that the reports were lies, for there were great liars
in the world, and he did not believe them.' Neither did Rust.
'He was astonished that people would circulate such tales; for
from all that he had seen of Ned, he was a fine, frank, open-hearted
fellow, although he must confess, that all who seemed so
were not so; and that he had not liked Ned at first, for he thought
that he had a 'down look,' (which, by the way, was rather remarkable,
as Ned always held his head peculiarly erect, as if to look all
the world in the face.) Rust, however, kept at work, rasping, and
rubbing, and picking away at Ned's character; inventing a thousand
things which had never happened, and whispering to the old man,
under promises of secresy, remarks which Ned had made of him,
which were not very respectful, and which Rust was surprised
(considering what a fine fellow Ned was, although others had a
different opinion of him) that Ned should make. Whatever may
have been the cause of his want of success, it is certain that it was
not very great, until the conversation with Harson opened Rhoneland's
eyes for the first time to a fact which he had never before
suspected; that Ned's visits were paid to his daughter and not to
himself; and that his child had given her affections to him. On
the back of that came the encounter with Michael Rust, and his
insinuations, that Ned was hovering round his daughter with the
purpose of dragging her from him, and deserting her when there
was no hope left for her but the grave.</p>

<p>No wonder then that when Somers was driven from the house,
the old man hugged his daughter in his arms, and wept over her,
and kissed her fair forehead, and pressed her face to his bosom, and
rested his cheek upon her head, while his whole frame shook with
heavy sobs, of mingled joy and indignation; nor that he kept near
her the whole of that day, scarcely suffering her to quit his sight,
locking the house door and always opening it himself when there
was a knock, lest it should be Somers, returning to lure his child
from him. Over and over again he begged her not to leave him;
conjuring her not to see Somers again, and telling her that Ned was
a scoundrel, and that the only mode of saving herself from destruction
was by never meeting him again.</p>

<p>And did Kate never see Somers again? But once and only
once. She knew that her father wronged him. She knew how
long and patiently he had been waiting and working for her. She
knew too that Michael Rust had his own designs upon her; for she
was not blind, and Michael Rust's admiration was too undisguised,
and his speech too devoid of concealment to leave her in doubt.
She knew too, although he had studiously concealed it from her,
that he was Ned's enemy, and that he wished to rid himself of a
rival; and she strongly suspected that he was at the bottom of this
whole matter. She knew all this, and she thought, that now that
the worst had taken place, that Ned should know it too; for she
had hitherto concealed much of it, lest it should lead to difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
between Somers and her father's guest. But nothing was to be
gained by concealment now; and she felt, that to see Somers, to tell
him all that she knew, all that she had seen, all that she had heard,
and all that she suspected, was but her duty, and that to refrain
from doing so would be very, <em>very</em> wrong. If she erred, it was an
error which many will forgive.</p>

<p>And under this conviction, she met him again, with her young
heart full almost to bursting. She met him to tell him every thing
that she knew or suspected of Rust, and his plans with reference
to herself, and to caution him against him; to tell him to watch
him; but above all, to incur no risk himself; to tell him that he and
she must meet no more until he could vindicate his name to her
father; to assure him, whatever others might say, or do, or think,
that she believed not the slanders circulated against him; to beg
him, that whatever others might say of her, or whatever attempts
might be made to separate them, or whatever tales might be fabricated
to make him doubt her faith and love, to believe them not; to
set them down as the base coinage of a baser heart; and to believe
that she loved him still; that in her heart of hearts he was still the
same to her that he always had been; and that he ever would be,
until that heart ceased to beat. She said this, and she said a
thousand times more, for she was meeting him with the full resolve
to meet him no more; with the full knowledge that their parting
must be at all events a long one, perhaps a final one.</p>

<p>They went over the same spots which they had lingered over in
happier days; the same out-of-the-way haunts, where there were
few to observe them; under the same old trees which stretched out
their long branches, now naked and stripped of foliage; along the
same bye-streets which they had selected on the day when he first
learned that she loved him. They spoke but little; for all that Ned
could do was to assert that the tales which had been repeated to
her father were false; to wonder who the slanderer was, breathe
forth vengeance against him, and to suggest the propriety of belaboring
Rust soundly, and running the risk of the flogging falling on
the right shoulders. And all that Kate could say in return was to
repeat her utter disbelief in every thing that went to show that Ned
was not all that she had supposed and wished him to be.</p>

<p>Thus the day lingered on; and the time came for parting. They
said but little, for there were no bright prospects to cheer them on:
a few words of encouragement faintly spoken, for their hearts whispered
that they were vain; a few broken words of hope, uttered in
so sad a tone that they seemed a mockery; a stifled 'God bless you,
Kate!' as he pressed her to his heart; a 'Good by, Ned,' half sobbed,
and they parted, and Kate hurried to her own room; and hiding her
face in her hands wept the bitterest tears that she had ever shed in
her life. But the agony was over; they had parted; and now she
told her father that they had met; and why; and that they were to
meet no more until he could vindicate himself. The old man heard
her out, contrary to her expectations, without an expression of
anger, and merely said, that 'it was very well, as it was; that she
did right to see him no more;' and that was all.</p>

<span class="smcap">Old American Ballad.</span>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thou</span> knowest, <span class="smcap">Diedrich</span>, that it has long been settled that Noah
landed in America, and that Mount Ararat is in the State of New-York.
I am inclined to believe, from this undoubtedly genuine ballad,
which I discovered in the lining of an old trunk in the garret of
the principal inn at Ramapo, that the Jews resided here at a much
later period of their history; but that has nothing to do with us at
present. All that I wished to prove by the ballad is, that the great
wielder of jaw-bones was hen-pecked. So was Cicero.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> So was
Mr. Liner. Mr. Liner was, beside, pullet-pecked. Miss Catharine
pecked him. Not that Miss Catharine was by any means ill-natured;
for I have seen her only 'grin a ghastly' when she met a rival belle
better dressed; but she made her poor father keep his eyes open
night after night, by pinching himself, and by wondering at her
astonishing strength of limb, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">effera vis crurum</i>,' as he delighted to
call it. And when the old gentleman would hint to his daughter
that he thought it high time to depart, she would meet his suggestion
by a decided negative: 'Oh no! not yet, pa!' pronounced with
that sweet asperity and bitter mellifluousness of manner, which we
often notice in people whose toes have been trodden upon by a distinguished
stranger, who apologizes. Metaphysically speaking, her
tone was a cross between a smile and a snarl.</p>

<p>In the summer Miss Liner visited at the watering-places&mdash;Saratoga,
Sharon, Rockaway&mdash;and returned fully impressed with the
truth of a late traveller's remark: 'The social intercourse of American
watering-places may be defined as follows: the gentlemen spit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and the ladies spat.' She herself came home with no less than five
quarrels on her hands, which she was heroical enough not to regret,
when the five foes gave parties and left her out.</p>

<p>The first year or two of this kind of life was very pleasant; but
as winter after winter rolled on its balls, and summer after summer
found her haunting the same places, and she found herself still
remaining Liner, a sigh, soft yet spiteful, escaped from her 'heaving
breast.'</p>

<p>(<i>Nota.</i>&mdash;All breasts 'heave' in romances, as if they were Irishmen
employed in coal-yards.)</p>

<p>'Why,' whispered she, softly, 'can I not find some one on whom
I may lavish the treasures of affection that I have been hoarding for
so many years?'</p>

<p>'There,' hissed she, spitefully, 'is that Henrietta Hoogeboom, not
half so stylish as I am, and a miserable waltzer, and yet she is
engaged!'</p>

<p>One young man, a foreigner from Tobolsk, encouraged by her
bravos at his performances, did propose; but was indignantly refused.
Old Mrs. Liner, who was a little à la Malaprop, said, crimson with
rage, that she 'wouldn't make use of him as a foot-pad.' Had the
youth from Tobolsk asked a few years later, he would have been
accepted. A man can carry off any single woman, if he only
chooses the right time. Drowning men are said to catch at straws.
It may be so. We have never witnessed a drown, and cannot say:
but spinsters about sinking into the vast profound of old-maidism
do catch at straw men. This we can assert.</p>

<p>No good parti offered. Attention too began to be scanty. The
world of beaux, empty-stomach'd as empty-hearted, rushed to her
balls to enjoy the suppers, and to dance with newer belles. They
were smiling but unsatisfactory. Now and then some eager débutant
would claim her hand for a waltz, and lead her off in triumph,
amid the sneers of the experienced. Pardon us, good friends, if we
again recur to the romance, the <em>analyses</em> of which we have been
giving you:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> ball room was bright and beautiful. Two thousand candles
shone in the lofty rooms; two hundred belles flashed as they sidled
in the waltz and simpered in the cotillion. The 'middle ages' line
the walls; capped, sitting bolt upright, wide awake, smiling, but
looking out like highwaymen for rich young men. Tarpenny
descends from the dressing-room, and trembles. It is his fourth
party. Simple-minded youth! He feels the arduous nature of his
undertaking. He gives his hair the last adorning touch, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coup de
grâce</i>; with hands glued to sides, he enters, fixes his eye upon the
hostess, and rushes headlong at her. Politeness urges her to
advance to meet him; self-preservation prompts her to avoid.
Convulsively forward jerks his hand, eager for a shake; two taper
fingers only, cautiously advanced, are feebly placed within his
grasp. His friendly force betrays him; he shakes the air; loses his
balance; hops upon one foot. While on the hop, his rosy face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
meets a cognizant female eye. He bows upon one leg, totters
still, and half falls against a man of muslin. He jumps away, muttering
an indistinct '<em>Pardon!</em>' With a hot, painful sensation in the
face, he takes refuge behind a door, to emerge again when coolness
brings relief, and the nose no longer glistens. He looks about him,
and gallantly resolves to dance. Miss Liner meets his inquiring
eye. When a little boy he had seen beaux about her. It was
years ago. She is a belle. There can be no doubt about it. How
lucky that she is not engaged! He sees distinction close at hand,
and hurries to the hostess. She presents him. He stammers out
the question. Miss Liner grumbles a 'Yes.' He leads her off in
triumph. Short-sighted mortal!'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Liner</span> began to ask, 'Why don't the men come forrard?'
and old Liner was heard to mutter: 'Quousque tandem <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caty Liner</i>
abutêre patientiâ nostrâ?'</p>

<p>Another year, and the last faint <em>spark</em> expired.</p>

<p>'Why is it Mrs. Liner,' quoth the father, as he was tying his
night-cap strings, 'that our daughter cannot get a husband? I know
very well that Erasmus says, in speaking of women, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nulla bona,
Nullus beau</i>; but we, thank God! are rich, and I am sure we all
have tried hard enough. There was Shuffleshank, for instance.
Did not we run after him at balls, plays, concerts, until I got the
pleurisy, and you a bilious attack? And Catharine, poor soul! did
she not dance after him until she wore herself down to a skeleton?
and all for nothing? Something must be done, Mrs. Liner. Gad!
I have a plan&mdash;&mdash;' A rattling, reverberating snore completed
Mr. Liner's paragraph; and soon the married noses, blended in
harsh discord, pealed a lullaby through the bed-curtains. As to
Miss Catharine, she looked upon the first part of the proverb,
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L'homme propose</i>,' as an absurd and cruel fiction, invented by a
tantalizing wretch. And when her cousin, Miss Frizzle&mdash;who
like the Scythian in Elian was all face, and poor and ill-natured to
boot&mdash;when Frederica Frizzle, whose physiognomical and moral
qualifications were forcibly described by one of her friends as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nose carnation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temper darnation!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">when Miss Frizzle, I say, engaged herself to her first offer, a nice
musical young man, with the slightest possible moustache, then
Catharine waxed gloomy, and her snowy <i>batiste</i> was bedewed
with tears. As the poet hath it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Through fingers tiny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streamed the briny.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have now come to the beginning of our story. Miss Liner
sits weeping upon the sofa, regretting Shuffleshank and her first
offer from Tobolsk. It remains for us to see what was Mr. Liner's
plan.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sea rolls lazily, and whist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the motions of the whirling mist;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pantomime of air and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath a solemn witchery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which puzzles the cock, who has the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any one has, to know day-light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tired at last, he gives up, dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wondering when the morn will come;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The porpoise out on the fishing ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a running start, comes upward-bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then skimming along the ocean's brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just in tone with its solemn hymn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He snorts and blows, with a careless fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his short bob-tail, as it suited him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceedingly, that sort of thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, startled from her easy swing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fluttering of a sea-bird's wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moaning cry of some lost bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the dropping of a spar, is heard.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A moment in, and a moment out,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The gossiping Graves, now off the lee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may hear them muttering; either side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the ship heaves round with the lazy tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weary and faint, as a sick man raves,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THALES_OF_PARIS" id="THALES_OF_PARIS">THALES OF PARIS.</a></h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the hobbies cherished in the most especial manner by the
good citizen of Paris, is Philosophy; not that he takes delight in
the cultivation of wisdom, or makes the study of nature his pursuit:
but when things go well with him in the world; when his fortune
has reached the limit of his desires; when age has abated the ardor
of his passions, and in the bosom of his family he finds himself
surrounded with every comfort and luxury that heart could wish; he
fancies himself beyond the common accidents of life; he becomes a
philosopher. His philosophy is his pet, his play-thing, his hobby-horse
upon which he gets astride, and gambols like a frolicsome
child. Should his wife scold, should his roast-beef be burnt, should
a sudden shower break up a party of pleasure, he alone preserves
his equanimity; is smiling, soothing, and consolatory; he is a philosopher.
Philosophy is his sovereign panacea; with the understanding
that no precautions have been neglected to secure him as far as
possible against the weightier mishaps of life. His houses and furniture
are insured, and his money, instead of being exposed to the
hazards of joint stock companies or rail-roads, is safely invested in
the royal funds.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Herbois was a happy example of this consolatory system,
and seemed to have been sent into the world expressly for the
purpose of sounding the praises of philosophy, without ever being
obliged to test its efficacy in his own case. Wealthy by a paternal
inheritance, which thrift on his part had increased, he had early in
life married the woman of his choice; and his only son, about
twenty-two years of age, was now in his turn about to espouse a
young lady, whose character, fortune, and family all exactly suited
the fortunate father. And so Monsieur d'Herbois, a man of a naturally
placid and even temper, was now busying himself in preparing
the dower, or if you please the appanage of Gustavus, with the
benignity and disinterested solicitude of a sage.</p>

<p>'My friend,' said he to Monsieur Durand, who was not a philosopher,
'I shall give to Gustavus my house at Sussy. I well know
that this will be a great sacrifice, and that we cannot pass the summers
there any more, because it is possible that my wife cannot
agree on all points with her daughter-in-law; but we love Gustavus
so dearly!&mdash;and beside, one must be a philosopher. We shall therefore
live in Paris on the second floor; the first will be occupied by
the young folks. My wife grumbles a little at this; but says I to
her: 'My dear, suppose some unexpected calamity should occur, to
sweep away all our property?&mdash;what would then become of us?
Then we should have to climb up into the garret, and would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
forced to summon up all our philosophy, of which we shall scarcely
stand in need, merely to ascend a few additional steps. Thales of
Miletus acted in this manner, one of the seven wise men of Greece,
who endured all sorts of troubles without complaint, and in fact
defied all mankind to disturb the serenity of his soul and the tranquillity
of his spirit.'</p>

<p>'And do you give the same defiance to men as Thales did?' asked
Monsieur Durand.</p>

<p>'To be sure I do. You, my friend, ought to know whether I have
not the right to do so. Have you ever known me to depart from my
principles?'</p>

<p>'I know,' replied M. Durand, 'that during the time since you and
I left college together, which is now upward of thirty years, I have
never known you to be afflicted with any personal misfortune; and
if Thales of Miletus, whose story I do not now remember, was
always as lucky, his philosophy would not have cost him more than
yours does.'</p>

<p>'To speak candidly,' replied M. d'Herbois, with a good-natured-smile,
'I think that I am a little more of a philosopher than Thales
himself was; for I have never been inconsistent with my professions,
although a husband and a father, while Thales was a bachelor.'</p>

<p>'But still,' said his friend Durand to him, 'you have never been
put to the test.'</p>

<p>'Let the test come; I am ready.'</p>

<p>'Suppose your wife should prove false to you, or your son not
turn out in accordance with your expectations?&mdash;do you think
you would support these misfortunes with the constancy of Job?'</p>

<p>'Of Thales, my dear friend, of Thales, if you please; do not confound
them:</p>

<p class="center">
'For all events the wise man is prepared.'
</p>

<p class="noind">Thus said a poet who talked Greek, and not an Arab like your Job.'</p>

<p>M. d'Herbois, proud of Thales, of himself, and of philosophy,
proceeded to make careful preparations for the nuptials of his well-beloved
son; and already in his mind's eye beheld himself dandling
his little grand-children that were to be.</p>

<p>One morning he was about entering the apartment of Gustavus,
for the purpose of consulting him on the purchase of some jewels,
intended as a present for the bride. The chamber of the young
man was situated at one end of the room of M. d'Herbois. The
entrance to it was through this latter, and also by a private staircase,
which allowed the young man to go in and out without disturbing
any body. D'Herbois, just as he was about turning the
handle of the glass door, the curtain of which was on his side,
checked himself, on hearing the sound of voices. His son, he
found, was not alone.</p>

<p>'Oh, ho!' thought he, 'Gustavus is perhaps bidding farewell to the
bachelor's life. Can he be consoling some little beauty, who is
reminding my young master of his broken vows?'</p>

<p>He raised the corner of the curtain, and was a little tranquillized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
The companion of Gustavus was a man. 'May be it is a creditor,'
thought he; 'but this is a lesser evil.'</p>

<p>He placed himself so as to see and hear what was going on.
Opposite to him, in the middle of his son's room, stood a man of
about the age of M. d'Herbois, gray-headed, with a sharp and crafty
expression of countenance, and person enveloped in a large farmer's
riding-coat.</p>

<p>'My dear Peter,' said this person, 'listen to me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Peter?' replied d'Herbois junior; 'you are mistaken, Sir; my
name is Gustavus.'</p>

<p>'I am not mistaken, for all that,' continued the stranger; 'listen to
me, I entreat you, my good Sir; I am about to communicate a piece
of news which fills me with joy; my only fear, (and I confess it is a
natural one,) is that it will not give you as much pleasure.'</p>

<p>'Go on, Sir,' said Gustavus; 'nothing that is agreeable to an honest
man can give me pain; speak out.'</p>

<p>The man, whose presence singularly annoyed M. d'Herbois, deliberately
took a seat, and commenced thus:</p>

<p>'You know, my good Sir, that it is now about twenty years since
Madame d'Herbois gave birth to a son. On account of the weak
state of her health, she was not able to afford him nourishment herself.
A nurse was sought for, and it was my wife, Margaret Pithou,
of Pontoise, who was selected.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you are then my foster-father,' cried Gustavus, with open
arms; 'walk in, walk in; my father and mother will be delighted
to see you.'</p>

<p>'Softly! softly!' said Pithou; 'neither Monsieur nor Madame
d'Herbois must know that I am here, or have spoken with you, until
we have had a little explanation together, and you know all.'</p>

<p>'Until I know all! What is it, then, Monsieur Pithou? Pray go
on,' said Gustavus, impatiently.</p>

<p>'Patience, my good Sir; you shall hear all in good time.'</p>

<p>The more interesting and mysterious this conversation became,
so much the more immovable did his philosophy hold Monsieur
d'Herbois, who scarcely dared move, or even breathe.</p>

<p>'My wife and I,' continued Pithou, drawling out his words, 'like
most of our neighbors, were at that time dealers in a small way in
cattle. But provided the murrain did not get among the beasts, and
our cows kept healthy, we managed in one way or another to make
both ends meet at the end of the year. We were young then, and
had one child, a few months older than the son of Monsieur d'Herbois.'</p>

<p>'Than me?' exclaimed Gustavus.</p>

<p>'You shall see. As ill luck would have it, a speculator came
down from Paris, with plenty of money, and established himself at
Pontoise; bought up the finest cows, built large stables, raised the
price of hay and feed; and in short, broke up all the small dealers
like us; for the veal and mutton of this Parisian were always the
fattest and brought the best prices. One bad year ruined us. My
wife took it sadly to heart, and fell ill; her poor foster child felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
effects of her malady; we dared not say any thing, lest it should be
taken from us; in fine, my wife and the child of Monsieur d'Herbois
both died on the same night. My poor Peter!' continued
Pithou, addressing Gustavus, 'my poor Peter, I was then indeed in
a situation to excite pity: nothing left me, no wife, no money, plenty
of debts, and an infant in the arms, which looked up to me for support.
A thought from heaven suddenly seemed to strike me. Said
I to myself, 'The rich are placed here to succor the poor, and render
them assistance; but as they are often hard-hearted, selfish, and
avaricious, we must have recourse sometimes to stratagem to obtain
from their credulity what their indifference refuses.' In pursuance
of this idea, I gave out every where that my son was dead, and sent
you, my own offspring, to M. d'Herbois, under charge of cousin
Potard, who was herself the dupe of my trick. Yes, you are my
own son Peter! my dear Peter!'</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this strange story, Pithou arose, drew Gustavus
to him, kissed his forehead, his eyes, his hair, and bedewed
the young man, who seemed lost in amazement, with paternal tears.
'How otherwise, my dear child,' said he, 'could you have wished
me to have acted?' The time passed with Monsieur d'Herbois has
procured for you the advantages of a good education, and beside
that, has been so much exemption from suffering for you. In truth,
when I examine my motives, and think seriously of my conduct, I
cannot repent of it. Since then, fortune has been more propitious
to me. I came to Paris, engaged in trade, and as others have done
before me, have made a handsome fortune. You see that I am too
honest to allow you to profit by the riches of M. d'Herbois; we will
confess all to him. Adieu, my dear Peter! I have full proofs of
what I have told you; I am going to get them, and will take them
myself to M. d'Herbois.'</p>

<p>So saying, Pithou again embraced Gustavus, and departed by the
private stairs.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Herbois, upon whom not a word of this conversation
had been lost, knew not what to do or think. What! Gustavus,
his son! the child of whom he had not lost sight for twenty years;
whom he loved more than ever parent loved a son; for whom he
had deprived himself of so many comforts; who bore his name;
Gustavus to be called Peter! Peter Pithou! to be the son of another!
Monsieur d'Herbois was astounded, and in the utmost consternation
ran to seek his wife.</p>

<p>'Madame!' cried he, 'Madame d'Herbois, I have no longer a son;
my son has been dead for twenty years!'</p>

<p>Madame d'Herbois was a woman of a lively disposition, who
knew her husband well, and did not always take his words literally.</p>

<p>'You frightened me,' said she to him, laughingly; 'but as you say
that Gustavus has been dead for twenty years, I reassured myself
when I thought of the good appetite he had at breakfast this
morning.'</p>

<p>'Gustavus is not my son, Madame!'</p>

<p>'What do you mean by that, Sir?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>'Good heavens, Madame, you do not comprehend me! I mean
that he is no more your son than he is mine. Poor Gustavus died
while nursing; we have got the son of Pithou, Peter Pithou!'</p>

<p>The amazed couple then recalled all the details of the early
infancy of Gustavus. He had, in fact, been placed at nurse at Pontoise,
and the child had been brought home in consequence of the
death of his nurse, Margaret Pithou. All that Pithou had related
had the appearance of truth; perhaps, alas! was true.</p>

<p>Gustavus at this moment entered his mother's apartment, and
M. d'Herbois now for the first time remarked that the young man
did not resemble him as much as he had formerly fancied; in fact,
he had neither the same eyes, the same features, nor the same figure.
M. d'Herbois also mentally observed that the voice of Gustavus had
the same tones as that of Pithou. Gustavus, embarrassed by his
secret, knew not how to commence the painful disclosure; his eyes
filled with tears; he turned from M. d'Herbois toward his wife, without
daring to address or embrace either of them.</p>

<p>'Come to my arms!' passionately exclaimed Madame d'Herbois;
'come here, my child; we know every thing; but you are, yes, you
are my son; I feel it in my love! I feel it in my heart! Come to
me, my dear son!'</p>

<p>'You know every thing?' said Gustavus; 'has Pithou, then,
already brought his proofs?'</p>

<p>'No, my child, but your father overheard it all.'</p>

<p>A domestic entering, announced to M. d'Herbois that a person
was waiting to see him in his study.</p>

<p>'It is that Pithou,' said he, as he left the mother and son dissolved
in tears.</p>

<p>In the study he found his friend Durand.</p>

<p>'My good friend,' said Durand to him, 'as you are about marrying
your son, I thought you would like to have this beautiful cameo that
I have recently met with. I think it the finest I have ever seen.
Look at it; and it is not dear either.'</p>

<p>'To the devil with your cameo, and with the wedding, and with
my son too!' cried d'Herbois, beside himself with passion.</p>

<p>'Hey day! what's the matter now?' inquired Durand; 'has
Gustavus been getting into any scrape?'</p>

<p>'There is no such person as Gustavus. I have no longer any
son; there is only one Pithou; confounded be the whole race! one
Peter Pithou!'</p>

<p>D'Herbois then recounted to his friend the sad discovery he had
just made.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' said Durand, coolly, 'this is not so bad after all; the
matter may be amicably settled; M. Pithou will doubtless listen to
reason. He will possibly consent to leave Gustavus the name
which he has hitherto borne; and since you possess the affections
of the young man, what difference, after all, does it make to you?'</p>

<p>'What difference does it make to me!' replied M. d'Herbois, in a
fury. 'What difference? I have lost my son, my blood, my life!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
They have left me in his stead the descendant of a Pithou! And
do you ask me what <em>difference</em> does it make!'</p>

<p>'Patience, patience, my good Sir! Have you not always loved
him until now as if he were your son? Have not your paternal
bowels yearned toward him, as if in fact he had been Gustavus and
not Peter? Take my advice, my friend; arrange this matter with
Pithou. The young man will never lose the affection he bears you,
and it will be Pithou, and not you, who will have the worst of the
bargain.'</p>

<p>'The wretch!' continued d'Herbois, pacing the room with hurried
strides; 'to have played the fool with me in this manner! to
have trifled thus with my affections! But there are laws against
crimes like this! Thank Heaven! we live in a civilized land; we
have the code; the substitution of children is punishable in France;
I will invoke the law; I will bring the culprit before the tribunal,
and he shall receive the reward of his guilt.'</p>

<p>'But consider,' replied Durand; 'there were many extenuating
circumstances in this offence of Pithou. He was suffering from
want; his mind was distracted by grief for the loss of his wife. To
be sure, nothing can justify a crime; but if any thing could excuse
one, would it not be the anxiety of a father to save his child from
imminent death? Beside,' continued Durand, 'observe the conduct
of this man. As soon as he becomes wealthy, and is able to provide
for him, he comes to reclaim his son. He is not willing that
he should enjoy any longer the advantages of your wealth; he does
not even wait until his child has consummated an advantageous
marriage. All these circumstances would plead strongly in favor of
Pithou, in a court of justice. And, in fact, the offence is not the
complete substitution of a child; it is merely a temporary one; and
the court would probably adjudge Pithou to pay to you the expenses
of the education of Gustavus, or Peter; this would be all.'</p>

<p>But poor M. d'Herbois would not listen to his friend. He gave
himself up to all the violence of his passion, and began already to
feel in his heart a strange aversion to a son, whom until now he had
so tenderly loved.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said he, 'he has the very voice and look of Pithou;
his gestures, his walk. No doubt this Peter Pithou junior will turn
out a rogue, like his father.'</p>

<p>'But only one word,' said Durand; 'take my advice; marry Gustavus,
who is not to blame in this matter, and buy this beautiful
cameo. You will never get another such a chance.'</p>

<p>'I beg you, Sir, to hold your tongue about that cursed cameo!'
said d'Herbois, sternly, to his friend.</p>

<p>'But remember, my good Sir, you are a philosopher, and have
defied the whole world to disturb the serenity of your soul, or the
tranquillity of your spirit.'</p>

<p>'Philosopher! when I have lost my only child!'</p>

<p>'You have lost nothing. Gustavus is in good health. As for the
one that died twenty years ago, you have never known him; in
fact, have scarcely seen him. Beside, where is the merit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
advantage of philosophy, if it is not able to console you under
afflictions; to moderate grief, and impart to the mind the calmness
requisite to diminish evil, and enable you to arrive at truth?'</p>

<p>Instead of making answer, the philosopher burst into tears; two
briny streams flowed down his cheeks, attesting the vanity of his
stoicism, and the superiority of Thales of Melitus over Thales of
Paris.</p>

<p>'Ah ha!' exclaimed M. Durand, on witnessing the deep humiliation
of his friend, 'have I then conquered your philosophy? But
cheer up! Lapierre! Lapierre! come this way.'</p>

<p>Lapierre entered; he had laid aside his livery, and had on still
the farmer's large coat.</p>

<p>'Here is Pithou, and there is no other; it is Lapierre, my valet.
The claim he sets up for your son is all a matter of moonshine. I
was acquainted with all the circumstances, and laid my plans
accordingly. The true Pithou is still at Pontoise, employed in fattening
calves. He has married a second time, has a score of children,
and has no thoughts of coming here to claim a son who is none of
his. And now, Monsieur Philosopher, is it thus you put in practice
the professions you are daily preaching? Is it thus you exemplify
the maxims of the great Thales? Let but misfortune touch your
little finger, and you are beside yourself: you examine nothing, neither
the truth, nor even the probability of a thing; and before the
slightest proofs are laid before you, you withdraw your affections,
almost discard your child, and are eager to send a man off to the
galleys! And yet one of the maxims of Thales was, 'Never decide
any thing rashly.'</p>

<p>M. d'Herbois, confused and crest-fallen, hung down his head, and
by his silence confessed that the trial had been too severe for his
philosophy. Being, however, fortunately possessed of a large stock
of good-nature, which is sometimes better than philosophy, he did
not think it worth his while to quarrel with his friend. Poor Gustavus
alone suffered from the trial. M. d'Herbois from that time
forth could no more trace in his features that resemblance to himself
of which he had formerly been so proud; and when the young man
spoke, 'That is not my voice,' said he to himself; 'it is the very tone
of Pithou.'</p>

<p>And so Gustavus, although suitably married, did not get possession
of the country-house at Sussy, which was so agreeable to
M. d'Herbois during the summer season. Neither did the old folks
discommode themselves in town, and the young couple resided on
the second floor.</p>

<p>Convinced in this manner of the vanity of his philosophy,
M. d'Herbois quietly resumed his position as father and husband.
'It is impossible,' said he, 'to preserve one's serenity, if our happiness
is placed upon objects out of ourselves, and depends upon a
wife or child. So when the mother of Thales besought him to
marry, the sage replied, 'It is not yet time.' After a while she
renewed her entreaties; 'It is now too late,' said Thales.</p>

<p>In our days, the philosophy of most people commences the day
after marriage.</p>

<h2><a name="MEADOW-FARM_A_TALE_OF_ASSOCIATION" id="MEADOW-FARM_A_TALE_OF_ASSOCIATION">MEADOW-FARM: A TALE OF ASSOCIATION.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF 'EDWARD ALFORD AND HIS PLAYFELLOW.'</p>


<h3>CHAPTER FIFTH.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> common notion has been, that the mass of the people need no other culture than is necessary to fit
them for their various trades; and though this error is passing away, it is far from being exploded.'</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">'Self-Culture:' Channing.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cultivation of the soil is the most easily learned of any art.
It is falsely supposed that a certain degree of obtuseness, roughness,
clod-hopper ignorance, is essential to the farmer; that intelligence,
refinement, and science are poorly applied to agriculture. This is
the impression that farmers themselves have; and as a body they
mistrust the advantages of education as applied to their occupation.
The cause of this impression may be traced to the fact, that most
of the scientific farmers sink money in carrying on their farms,
while they who doggedly plough, plant, and dig, as their fathers did
before them, lay up money yearly. These successful men sneer at
the gentleman-farmer, and deride his science; and his yearly losses
only confirm them the more strongly in their previous habits. Now
they might be told that this gentleman farmer expects from the
beginning to sink money; that he has taken up the cultivation of
the land for amusement, health, or scientific experiment; that his
object is not to make money, but to gratify his taste, or perhaps benefit
the general farming interest of the country by his failures. It
can easily be understood that a very erroneous notion of the value
of science, as applied to agriculture, is likely to be drawn from such
instances, and how the true farmer comes to mistrust the spirit of
modern improvement.</p>

<p>It is pretty well understood among farmers that no man can succeed
in their employment who hires his labor. The price of products
is so low that wages consume all the profits. And yet there
is a great deal of labor hired on the land by those who have lately
begun to cultivate it; and the farmer should know that these persons
can afford to lose five or six hundred dollars a year, and that
they expect to do so, while learning the art of country life, and still
be better off than they would had they continued in commerce at a
yearly loss of as many thousands.</p>

<p>Much surprise is often expressed by those unacquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
facts, that the farm-houses of the country look so rough; that more
attention is not bestowed upon the cultivation of shade-trees and
pleasure-grounds. Why, they ask, are the houses unpainted? why
is it that the farmer's horse and cattle look as if they never felt the
curry-comb? His harness looks as if it were never washed, and the
owner himself only shaves on Sundays! Oh! farming must be a
horrid business! So dirty! such smells! and so slovenly! It will do
well enough in poetry and pictures, but Heaven preserve us from
this harrowing, dung-heaving life!</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the first business of the tiller of the
soil is to attend to his crops, his wheat-fields and corn-fields; to
think more of the fences around his pasture-lands than the flower-garden
before his house. He must think first of these, and afterward
of ornament. It must be confessed that the man who makes
money or who keeps his farm from running him in debt, 'in these
times,' must rise in the morning with his 'boys,' eat with them and
work with them. He must wear a coarse frock and thick boots, and
lead a rough but a healthful life. And we aver that the smell of
the barn-yard is like a bed of violets, when compared with the reeking
gutters of the city, and that the very gentlemen who take a pride
in eating cheese <em>all alive</em>, turn up their noses with a poor grace of
consistency at the earth-worms the plough-share turns up in the
furrow.</p>

<p>It is worse than idle for any man to expect to better his condition
in a pecuniary point of view, by turning gentleman farmer. If a
person have a fortune already, he may lay out pleasure-grounds,
fence in parks, make experiments in crops, try crosses in breeds of
cattle, and set out trees for shade and scenery, and thus gratify his
taste, and possibly make some discovery for others to benefit by;
but in his own case he will lose money; probably he expects it.
What would any one think of a gentleman warrior or gentleman
poet? that is, of a man who should hire all his fighting done or all
his verses made. If success only crowns individual, personal exertion
in all other matters, how is it that in this alone, in the primitive
occupation of mankind, men expect it, without putting their own
hand to the plough, and girding themselves for the labor? It is a
common remark among husbandmen that he who works with his
'hands' gets double the amount of work out of them compared with
him who only gives his orders and waits until they are accomplished.
The general must lead his troops to victory; he must endanger his
own life if he would infuse bravery into the hearts of his soldiers;
and this principle is not inapplicable to the 'boss' of the farm.</p>

<p>The snow was not yet off the earth when Rufus Gilbert and his
companions reached their new home in Landsgrove. It was one
of those late seasons when winter departs tardily and reluctantly,
but which almost always repay the farmer by a year of abundance.
Vegetation, when it does begin to appear, shoots up as if by magic,
and hardly has the snow melted from off the hills before flowers are
in blossom all over the valleys. But we must attempt to give the
reader some idea of the situation of the place at which they had
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The Green Mountains run north and south nearly in the centre of
the State of Vermont, on the west sloping toward Lake Champlain,
the Otter Creek river, and the eastern tributaries of the Hudson,
and on the east to the Connecticut river. The ascent begins on the
eastern side almost as soon as you leave the river. At whatever
point you attempt to cross the State, you meet hills which rise in
regular succession, until you reach the summit of the ridge. The
villages lie mostly in the valleys, although some are perched like
watch-towers on the elevations or table-lands of the mountains.</p>

<p>A small river runs through the southern part of the town of
Landsgrove, on its way to join the Connecticut. Here it rushes
through a narrow gap in the hills, in which its course was undoubtedly
once confined, where it formed a lake, now changed into a
broad extent of rich meadow land. All about this little amphitheatre
the hills rise, sometimes abruptly, and, on the north, by regular steps
or plats of table-land. It was upon one of these latter that Rufus
had built his house, fronting the south, and overlooking the whole
extent of the farm he had purchased.</p>

<p>Human contrivance could hardly have planned a situation so
agreeable to the eye, or one better suited to the purpose for which
he had made the purchase. Completely shut out from the rest of
the world, and yet near enough for all objects of trade and convenience,
he owned the whole of this little valley, with enough of
the upland for grazing. The widening of the river still left a small
lake or pond in the centre of his domain, well stocked by nature
with the daring trout which wanders fearlessly up the waterfalls in
search of food; and this little sheet of water added much to the
beauty of the prospect. The house, on an elevation itself, was protected
by still higher land from the cutting north winds, and the
plain on which it stood was just large enough for barns, out-buildings,
and a garden plat.</p>

<p>Our adventurers had enough to do from the very day of their
arrival to improve the snow-paths in drawing in their wood for the
next season; for the farmer must always be one year in advance of
the elements, and during one winter draws and cuts his wood for
the succeeding one. All hands were summoned to assist in this
their first united task. One felled the proper trees, taking care to
leave the sap-trees, the sugar-maple, untouched; others, the weaker,
drove the team and helped to load and unload, while the Stewarts
cut the wood into the proper sled length, eight feet. In this form it
was taken near the house and piled up, ready to be prepared, at odd
moments of time, for fuel. And even in this simple operation, at
the close of their first day's labor, they were all astonished at the
amount of work which had been accomplished. Each one, having
an allotted part to perform, acquired new skill every hour, and no
time was lost in changing from one kind of work to another. One
man, with the lever power, can lift large logs on to a sled, and do
his work alone; but he cannot do one fourth as much as four men
can perform in the same time, because he loses time in adjusting a
more complicated apparatus. He not only uses the lever, but rolls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the logs on an inclined plane, and these must be taken up and put
down again for every stick of timber, while the four men, at one
effort, lift it at once upon the sled. The mechanical powers enable
one man to do alone what he could not do at all without their assistance;
but the advantage of their application is by no means universal.
On ship-board they are of incalculable service, standing in the
place of seamen, whose maintenance and room is of great relative
value; for by means of the capstan, ten men can raise an anchor,
which, without it, one hundred men could not start; and two men
will run up a sail with a pulley, which would resist the strength of
many hands. Now any one can see that to keep one hundred men
solely to raise the anchor and run up the sails, and who could not in
the intervals be employed profitably otherwise, would be a great
expense. But on a farm, if it be large enough, no hour is lost; so
that ten men united will accomplish more than ten times as much
as one man working alone, with all the mechanical power he can
bring to his assistance. And as the mechanical powers when combined
are capable by one pound of power of lifting millions of
pounds' weight, so the force, strength, and capacities of men may be
so arranged and systematized, the second acting on the results of
the first, and the third on the second, and so on, to produce effects
which individual actors would never dream of.</p>

<p>Unimportant as this first effort of their united labor might seem,
all the young men were highly delighted with their success, and as
they met in the common hall of the house at supper, Ruth, Clara,
and the mother of the Stewarts had a story to tell about the expedition
with which all domestic affairs had been arranged. One had
taken supervision of the sleeping-rooms, another of the kitchen furniture,
and a third had arranged the library, as it was called, a room
which was to answer the threefold purpose of school-room, chapel,
and lecture-hall. The woodmen returned to find every thing in
order, a plentiful supper spread for their repast, and smiling faces
all around the board; as people are always cheerful when they have
done good actions.</p>

<p>Rufus Gilbert, as he sat at the head of the full table, for they
numbered fourteen souls, and glanced at the happy countenances of
his friends, felt as if his experiment was no longer doubtful. The
party lingered long over the table, which each one might feel was
his own, talking of the various duties of the next day, of the friends
they had left; and the infant delight of two orphan children Rufus
had brought with him, whom the novelty of the scene excited to ask
a thousand questions, was not repressed amid the general satisfaction.
Their impressions were listened to with attention, their inquiries
answered, and the little fellows became careful what they said,
when they found that their careless words were replied to in earnest.
At length, when the company had separated for the night,
all except Rufus and Philip, who were too full of hope to regard
fatigue, the two young men drew together before the fire, to compare
their impressions of their progress, each afraid to speak first,
lest the other should think him extravagant; but Philip could not
be silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>'The happiest day of my life!' at length broke from him.</p>

<p>'And of mine!' responded Rufus.</p>

<p>'Brother, friend, let us thank God for this hour!' said Philip,
grasping the hand of Rufus, 'for preserving us along our journey,
for bringing us together to this peaceful home, in health and strength;
for my heart is too full for any words but prayer.'</p>

<p>'Most cheerfully and devoutly,' said Rufus. And the brothers
knelt together, and Philip prayed for all beneath their roof; and not
alone for them, but for the poor, the oppressed, the ignorant, and the
destitute in all lands. They rose from their knees calmer and better
prepared to talk together.</p>

<p>'I have read somewhere,' said Rufus in the course of their conversation,
'and the remark struck me as forcible at the time, that
men ought to mistrust too favorable beginnings. If in any undertaking
every thing goes very smoothly at first, if no obstacles meet
you, no misgivings cloud you, you may be sure there is something
wrong in your plan. And this quaint writer then remarks, to support
his theory, that the early blossoms are apt to be nipped by the
frost.'</p>

<p>'And the Scripture hath it still more pointedly; indeed, what very
wise or very true saying has not a parallel passage in the Bible? I
have often thought that a most interesting book might be made,
showing how much even Shakspere accords with the sacred page.'</p>

<p>'The Bible was once read more thoughtfully than it is now,' said
Rufus; 'it made a more important part of the instruction of the
youth; its words fell with a deeper accent upon the heart of the
young man; it was handled reverently and read devoutly. Shakspere
must have been familiar with it, or himself divinely inspired.'</p>

<p>'Then you argue failure from our happiness to-night,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'No, but let us study caution; you did not hear me out, for I have
a commentary to make. Early success makes men heedless; obstacles
and difficulties render them thoughtful and wary. But it is
better not to be excited with our first gains, and then we shall have
no need of this severe training. Think of this. I will think of it
myself; good night' Having succeeded in cooling his own ardor
by attempting to bring Philip's feelings down to temperate heat,
with a meaning smile on his face, Rufus retired to repose.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER SIXTH.</h3>

<p class="center">THE SUGAR CAMP.</p>

<p class="center">
'<span class="smcap">There</span> might you have beheld one joy crown another.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Winter's Tale.</span><br />
</p>

<p>As soon as the snow began to melt, another important item of
the spring work of the Vermont farmer demanded the attention of
the household; no less a business than the making of maple sugar.
To this all hands repair, in expectation of many a sweet lump not
only of sugar, but of a taste of cherry lips and rosy cheeks. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
lads and lasses of the green mountain region begin to lick their lips
about the middle of March. The season of the frolic varies many
weeks in different years. When warm spring days are succeeded
by cool, freezing nights, when the light snows begin to fall, called
the 'poor man's manure,' from an idea, true or false, that they fertilize
the land, then the sap begins to run, and all hie to the sugar-camp
to work and play by turns.</p>

<p>The place selected for operations is often near a clump of hemlock
trees, amid whose thick branches a temporary shelter is erected.
Boards, straw, and buffalo robes secure a warm and deep sleep
after the excitement of the sugaring. Blazing fires burn up here
and there, over which the huge kettles, containing the sap, are
suspended on cross sticks, replenished now and then from the
extempore buckets, troughs roughly hewn in blocks of hard wood,
which hang to receive the drippings, drop by drop, from the incisions
made in the tree. After it has been boiled to a proper consistency,
it is suffered to cool, and with no more labor, becomes the famous
maple sugar, the delight of all children and many full-grown people.
It is run in fanciful moulds, and easily assumes any shape when in
a moist, warm state. The Indians prepare it in bark, curiously
ornamented with quill work and beads, and sell it to travellers at an
exorbitant price.</p>

<p>Since the abolition movement, many of the members of which
society make a virtue of consuming nothing raised by slave-labor,
this sugar has become a more important article of trade, and the
trees which produce it are guarded with great care. The temperance
cause, too, is giving it a new value, as many have the idea
that spirit cannot be extracted from it so well as from the West
India molasses, which favorite 'sweet'ning' of the Yankee is getting
into disrepute with the ultras; a fact which speaks louder for their
zeal than their knowledge. So it is engaged in as a serious matter
of profit, and the hilarity and fun that once were ripe in the sugar-camp
is departed. In former days it yielded not to husking frolics
in enjoyment; it was the vintage of the north; but those days are
gone, with many a simple custom and innocent pastime which the
spirit of modern improvement is frowning down.</p>

<p>Formerly the expedition lasted several days, and the sugar-makers
slept in the woods; now the increased population of the
State affords a house near to the orchards. Our friends were determined
to make the most of the time, and Rufus was glad of a little
amusement for the band, but newly leagued together, to wean the
thoughts of the home-loving from their old to their new abode; to
create pleasant associations about the place not yet honored with a
name.</p>

<p>As soon as a light fall of snow was succeeded by a warm,
sunshiny day, they all repaired to the woods, and a thrifty clump
of trees having been found, commenced their work. The place
was not a mile from their house, but a hut was erected as for a
regular, old-fashioned encampment, and conveniences for sleeping
were not forgotten. And it was well they were not omitted, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
late in the afternoon, as they were thinking of returning home,
there burst upon them a crowd of visitors from the neighboring
settlements, who had waited for this time to make their introduction
to their neighbors, wisely choosing a day of merriment, when the
heart is open, to spur on their own bashfulness and insure a cordial
reception.</p>

<p>If any one is surprised that the news of the contemplated gathering
should get abroad so quickly, he has only to live in the
country to discover that it is in vain to attempt secrecy in any
thing. Whether birds, dogs, or cats carry news, we will not pretend
to say; but all we know is, that one may gain information to any
extent about any body, who is worth the notice, in a country village.
The fact proves the skill that may be acquired in any art by persevering
industry, and the fact is all we can state, leaving the wonder
unsolved still, for the future investigation of some writer upon the
mysteries of human life in general.</p>

<p>We say it was well the sleeping-berths were not omitted, for so
numerous was the gathering, that when night drew on, our friends
found that beside taking up all the spare beds in the house, and
leaving a goodly number in the hut, they should be obliged to give
others a bed in the barn, on the hay-mow. But to this the Vermonter
does not object, occasionally, when on a frolic; and, indeed,
one very essential part of a frolic in the country, and in the city,
and in every place, is the doing of things, not better, more joyously
and handsomely than usual, but differently. If a man sleep on
feathers at home, and in a carpetted room, and eat with a silver fork,
it is a frolic to him to eat with his fingers, drink from large leaves,
and find rest even in a barn.</p>

<p>The hospitality with which the visiters were greeted, the trouble
of having their home turned upside down, for one night, was no
loss in any sense to the band; for on the next morning, as the day
was favorable, they all turned out to assist in making sugar in
earnest; and, before they departed, left the most ample proof of
their good wishes and sense of Rufus's kindness. One remembered
that he had brought a keg of butter in his sleigh, which his
father had sent, begging Mr. Gilbert's acceptance; another unloaded
baskets full of dried apples, as his offering of friendship with the
new neighbors; a third, a brawny youth of eighteen, was tugging
to lift alone a barrel of something from his sleigh, to show his
strength to the girls; (every Green Mountain boy being required,
before he can be considered marriageable, to load and unload his
barrel of cider;) a task rather beyond his powers. John Stewart
stepped forward to assist him, and asked the nature of the contents
that made his lift so heavy.</p>

<p>'Some of our best cider; the first run from the orchard greenins,'
said the youth.</p>

<p>'We drink no such stuff here,' said John; 'but Mr. Gilbert will be
very glad to take it to make into vinegar.'</p>

<p>'Vinegar!' exclaimed the young man, opening his eyes to be
certain he was not dreaming, 'make <em>that</em> cider into vinegar! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
won't be made into vinegar. You might bring all the teetotallers
at once to look sour at it; swear at it; damn it up hill and down,
and finally keep it into the middle of eternity, and then pour out a
mug, and it would sparkle as bright as ever.'</p>

<p>It was touching the young farmer on a tender point to speak disparagingly
of his cider; and this has been the great obstacle to be
got over in the Temperance reform. Thousands have refused to
have any thing to do with the cause, because cider was forbidden in
the pledge; and in our opinion the bigots in this cause (for Temperance
has its bigots as well as other causes) have presented the
question in an untenable form. They have attempted to show that
a natural fruit of our region, which cannot be preserved for any
length of time, except by expressing the juice, which is slightly
mixed with alcohol, is a deadly poison. Now the farmer who has
hundreds of bushels of apples yearly, beside those which are fitted
to keep sound, knows no other course than to make them into cider;
and he argues that the natural product of the soil on which he dwells
cannot be a poison; he knows that the <em>spirit</em>, as he calls it, meaning
the alcoholic principle, in the juice of the apple, preserves it; and
when the Temperance apostle comes to him and tells him that this
gift of God is a rank poison, he is disgusted with the whole subject,
and doubts the sincerity and honesty of those who really are the
friends of man, and who are laboring at a pecuniary loss for his and
others' good.</p>

<p>The course of Rufus was quite otherwise. The noise attracted
the attention of the whole party, and twenty or more young farmers
gathered about the youth, who stood over his barrel of cider, ready
to support its merits.</p>

<p>'Thank your father in my name,' said Rufus, approaching the
place, 'for his kind offer. We will accept it gladly, and doubt not it
is as good cider as any in Vermont; he no doubt will suffer us to
use it in any way we please.' The opportunity was too favorable
to be lost; so he went on to explain why he did not drink it, and the
league which had been made with his companions, which in short
hand amounted to this.</p>

<p>All the gifts of Providence are good in their place. Men have
the power of perverting the blessings of Heaven to curses. It
sometimes becomes necessary to abstain from innocent acts, because
others deduce wrong inferences from them. Cider and wine, which
in their nature contain alcohol, when drank in moderation, are salutary
to health, and are nourishing to the body; but we agree to
abstain from them because it is dangerous for those whose constitutions
have been debilitated by intemperance to indulge in these
luxuries. They bring back the old disease in such cases. And
as Paul said he would eat no meat (a thing good in itself) if his
doing so caused his brother to offend, so we have agreed to deny
ourselves cider and wine, for the sake of our fellow-men.</p>

<p>It was evident from the looks of all, that they cared more for the
reputation of their cider than for the liquor itself; and when Rufus
had finished his remarks, the youth who had brought the barrel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the first to propose that it be emptied upon the ground. It was
done with a shout; and so much influence had the words of Rufus,
that, with one accord, they all joined in a compact, on the spot, to
abstain from cider and all intoxicating drinks. Never did a sugar
party terminate more agreeably or profitably for all concerned.</p>

<h2><a name="LITERARY_NOTICES" id="LITERARY_NOTICES">LITERARY NOTICES.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Lectures on the Civil Government of the Hebrews.</span> By E. C. <span class="smcap">Wines</span>, Author of 'Two
Years in the Navy,' Works on Education, etc. Delivered at the New-York Society Library
Rooms.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we first saw the advertisement of Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span> in the public journals, it
struck us that the theme he had chosen for his lectures was a <em>dry</em> one, and that it would
scarcely be found to interest the general public; but we were greatly in error. It was
not only an unhackneyed subject, of intrinsic interest, but it was one that had never
before been treated in the manner in which it was presented by Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span>. We are
no longer surprised that the lectures should have drawn together overflowing audiences
in Philadelphia, nor that they were received with the most marked approbation in our
own metropolis. Although the chief authority whence the materials of the discussion
are drawn is the Bible, a book in every body's hands, yet the facts in the record are
brought by Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span> into such new and sometimes almost startling relations, that
while they impart important instruction on a subject venerable by its hoary antiquity, they
have yet all the charms of <em>novelty</em> to recommend them. Even acute and diligent students
of the Scriptures, after listening to his discourses, must confess that they have not exhausted
its riches, especially so far as they treat of the great principles of social organization
and constitutional government. Indeed, one of their best fruits will be to send the
hearer with a keener spirit of inquiry, and with increased patience and industry of investigation,
to the 'Lively Oracles.' The lectures are conceived in a liberal and philosophical
spirit, and evince an ardent attachment to, and a firm faith in, our republican institutions.
They are written with thorough scholarship and learning, and in a style always
lucid and vigorous, often glowing and elegant. In a word, Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span> takes hold of his
subject like a man who is conscious of his strength, and he almost invariably carries the
sympathies and convictions of his audience along with him, even when advancing
opinions quite out of their ordinary habitudes of thought. He has shown how thoroughly
a subject, which has been commonly regarded as belonging exclusively to <em>scholars</em>, can
be brought within the grasp of the popular mind. Whatever currency his elaborate and
most interesting disquisitions on the laws and government of the Hebrews may have,
will be so much subtracted from the strength of infidelity, and added to the cause of
sacred learning and religion.</p>

<p>The lecturer commenced with a reference to the magnificent sepulchral remains of an
unknown city on the banks of the Ganges, in Central India, as an emblem of the uncertainty
which accompanies most of our researches into the events of remote antiquity.
The writings of the best of the Greek historians were represented as filled with contradictions,
and with mutual charges of error and falsehood; and several striking instances
of historical doubt were adduced; as, whether the famous Trojan war ever actually
occurred or not; whether Semiramis lived two thousand or seven hundred years before
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and whether the Great Cyrus fell in battle near the snowy Caucasus, or died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in peace in his palace at Persepolis. The noble historic record of Moses was contrasted
with the confused and incredible fictions which disfigure all other ancient annals; and a
just eulogium was passed upon its clearness and consistency. Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines's</span> brief but
clear analysis of the political and social institutions of the various ancient Asiatic dynasties,
as also of Egypt, Sparta, Athens, and Rome, fully established his main position in
reference to them, that they knew nothing about the true principles of civil liberty; but
were, at all times, governed either by arbitrary <em>men</em> or arbitrary <em>laws</em>. A sober, rational,
well-poised, and well-guarded national freedom was nowhere to be met with in the
ancient world, except in Palestine, under the occupancy of the Hebrews; and all
antiquity did not afford a single example of a state, where the <span class="smcap">PEOPLE</span> exercised any just
influence in public affairs, till we come to the Jewish republic. The far-famed Spartan
Institutes were discussed with merited severity. Their barbarous and even brutal characteristics
were drawn in strong relief, but without a single darker shade than truth
required. It was admitted that the Spartans were the bravest, the most warlike, the
best skilled in the art military, the most politic, the firmest in their maxims, and the
most constant in their designs, of all the people of Greece; but in making them so,
Lycurgus had stripped them of almost every quality of men, and caused them to put on
the fierceness of savage beasts. The war-laws of ancient times were sketched in vivid
but truthful colors. One cannot but regard with horror the spirit of barbarity and cruelty
that reigned in almost every ancient nation. Death or slavery was the inevitable portion
of the vanquished. Cities reduced to ashes; sovereigns massacred in cold blood, and cast
out a prey to dogs and vultures; children crushed to death at the breast; queens dragged
unworthily in chains, and outrage and humiliation added to the rigors of captivity; these
were but the common consequences of victory. And to crown all, the horrible practice
of poisoning the arrows to be used in battle was almost universal. The general military
regulations of Moses were examined and contrasted with those of the other nations;
and, though undeniably severe when compared with the war-laws of our day yet most
essential modifications, tending to the progress of refinement and humanity, were introduced
into his military code. The severities exercised toward the Canaanites formed no
part of the general war-system, having been employed by special warrant and for a
specific purpose&mdash;the punishment and prevention of idolatry and unnatural lusts.</p>

<p>The institution of slavery was next discussed at considerable length; and an interesting
and instructive contrast was drawn between the condition of bond-service as it
existed among the Hebrews and in the other nations. The relation of slavery is so
ancient that its origin is lost amid the shadows and uncertainties of early legendary traditions.
It is, however, a most curious fact, that probably more than one half of the
human family have at all times been in bondage to the other, and have been looked upon
as the rightful properly of their masters. Gibbon estimates the slave population of the
Roman Empire at sixty millions, fully a moiety of the whole; and the proportion of the
slaves to the free citizens in Greece almost exceeds belief, being, according to the
accurate Mitford, more than four to one. In reference to Eastern nations, we are without
these exact statistics; but we have every reason to believe that the slave population
was immense. In all these nations the slaves were reduced to the lowest possible
depression; and were, in every sense, at the absolute disposal of capricious, greedy,
imperious, and merciless owners. They might be tortured, maimed, or put to death,
without let or hindrance from the civil power. Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span> gave a variety of deeply
interesting details in illustration of these positions. Moses did not abolish slavery; he
could not do it, without a miracle wrought upon men's minds. He was too wise to make
the attempt, when failure would have been the certain consequence. But he so modified
and softened the relation; he so fenced it about with checks, and restrictions, and guaranties;
that it was disarmed of most of the evils flowing from it in other countries. Servitude,
under the institutes of Moses, at least so far as Hebrew servants were concerned,
resembled the system of <em>apprenticeship</em> in vogue in this country, where a child is bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
out for a certain number of years for a stipulated compensation, to be paid to the parent
at the end of that period. In no nation, either ancient or modern, has slavery existed
under so mild a form, and guarding the rights and persons of the slaves with such jealous
care, as among the ancient Hebrews. These topics, and some to which we have not
had space to allude, were discussed in the opening lecture. In his second, the learned
Professor drew a portrait of the illustrious Hebrew sage and law-giver, developed the
general policy of his laws, and traced the obligations of other nations, in their legislation
and philosophy, to his institutes. Moses was described as possessing, in an eminent
degree, all those endowments, natural and acquired, which form the character of a consummate
chief magistrate of a nation; an intellect of the highest order; a perfect
mastery over all the civil wisdom of the age; a judgment cautious, penetrating, and far-reaching
in its combinations; great promptness and energy in action; patriotism that
neither ingratitude nor rebellion could extinguish, or even cool; a persuasive eloquence;
a hearty love of truth; an incorruptible virtue; and a freedom from selfish ambition, and
a greatness of soul, in which none of the most admired heroes of ancient or modern
times has ever surpassed him. These positions were proved and illustrated at large;
and the lecturer concluded his sketch with a beautiful parallel between the military and
civic character of <span class="smcap">Moses</span> and <span class="smcap">Washington</span>; both were men whom their compatriots
placed in the highest position, and both managed their authority so as to produce the
'greatest good of the greatest number.'</p>

<p>In entering upon his account of the political system of Moses, Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span> insisted,
with great earnestness, that all the essential principles of civil liberty and constitutional
government were as thoroughly embodied in his constitution, as they are in ours; and
in fact, that that great charter of human freedom, the <span class="smcap">Declaration of American
Independence</span>, which, like the writing on the wall of Belshazzar's palace, has troubled
the thoughts of many a tyrant, and caused his knees to smite one against the other, was
but an echo from the deep thunders of Mount Sinai. His great maxims of policy were
remarkably sound and judicious. The entire and absolute political equality of the whole
body of citizens; the discouragement of a spirit of war and military conquest; the
appointment of agriculture as the chief employment of the nation; the universal education
of the people, especially in the knowledge of the history, constitution, and laws of
their own country; a firm union of hearts and sentiments; and the indispensable necessity
of a well-contrived and well-guarded system of checks and balances between the
several departments of the government; these were the organic principles on which he
founded his civil polity. The lecturer laid down the proposition broadly and without
qualification, that there never was a nation, ancient or modern, in which the people stood
upon so perfect a level in regard to political rights and influence as the Jews under the
Constitution of Moses. Property in the soil is the natural foundation of power, and consequently
of authority. Hence, the natural foundation of every government is laid in the
distribution of its territory. If the prince own the lands, as was the case anciently in
Egypt, and is now in many Eastern governments, such prince will be absolute; for the
people, holding of him, and at his pleasure, will be in the condition of slaves rather than
of free men. If the land be shared among a few men, the rest holding as vassals under
them, as in the feudal system, the real power and authority of government will be in
the hands of an aristocracy, or nobility, whatever power may be lodged in one or more
persons, for the sake of greater unity in counsel and action. But if the lands be equally
divided among all the members of a society, the true power of such government will
reside in all the members of the society, and the society itself will constitute a real
democracy, whatever form of union may be adopted for the better direction of the whole
as a political body. Now this last is an exact description of the provision of the Hebrew
constitution in reference to property in the soil. Moses legislated for a people without
land, and who had their territories to gain at the point of the sword. He was not therefore
trammelled by any prescriptive rights, or long-established laws of inheritance. He
was free to adopt any principle he might deem most expedient. The principle actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
chosen by him was that of the equal division of all the conquered territories among the
whole six hundred thousand citizens; and to render this equality solid and permanent,
the tenure was made inalienable, and the estates thus originally settled in each family,
were to descend, by an indefeasible entail, in perpetual succession, to all the heirs-male
of the original proprietors. Such was the oldest of Agrarian laws. The wisdom of this
provision was most refined and admirable. It made extreme poverty and overgrown
riches alike impossible, and thus annihilated one of the greatest sources and engines of
ambition. It gave every member of the body politic an interest in the soil, and consequently
in the maintenance of public order and the supremacy of law over mob violence.
It elevated labor to its just dignity, by making the virtues of industry and frugality
necessary elements in every man's character. It cut off the sources of luxury, that corruptor
and bane of states, by denying the means of it, and took away the strongest incitement
to it in the example of others. It served to keep up that original equality of the
citizens, which was fundamental to the legislation of Moses, and altogether conformable
to its strong democratic spirit and tendency. It rendered it impossible for any Israelite
to be born to absolute poverty, for it gave to each his hereditary modicum of land; a
garden, an orchard, or an olive-grove. In preventing poverty, it cut off the most prolific
source of emigration, and thus preserved unimpaired the strength and vigor of the state.
It tended strongly to perfect the science of agriculture. And, finally, it served to bind
every Hebrew to his native soil by almost indissoluble ties, and gave to the sentiment of
patriotism an almost passionate fervor and intensity. The entire political equality of the
citizens was proved by various other arguments, and illustrated with great copiousness
of detail.</p>

<p>The system of checks and balances between the several powers of government, provided
by the constitution of Moses, evinced the deepest political wisdom, and a most
patriotic regard to the public liberties. History is full of proofs that restless and ambitious
spirits are the growth of all times and nations. Now there are two principal
methods of preventing the evils of ambition; either to take away the common occasions
of ambitious views, or to make the execution of them difficult and hazardous. The
Hebrew constitution made both these provisions in a manner equal, if not superior, to
any known constitution of government in the world. Never did legislator labor with
such eagle-eyed jealousy as Moses, to preserve the people from the dangers of ill-balanced
power, or guard the public liberty with so many and so admirably-contrived
defences against the projects of factions and restless ambition. We regret that we cannot
follow the learned lecturer through his earnest and unanswerable argument in support
of these positions. All who heard it will yield a full assent to the remark with
which he concluded it, that the provisions of the Hebrew government to prevent faction
and ambition incomparably surpass all the constitutions of the famed Spartan law-giver
for the same purpose, so celebrated in ancient story; nor would they have missed their
praise, had they been published by a Lycurgus, a Solon, a Numa, or indeed by any body
but Moses. The great principles of the Jewish law early became known to the contemporaneous
nations, and were powerfully felt in modifying their political institutions, their
philosophical opinions, and their moral practices. This influence was traced in the
clearest manner by Professor <span class="smcap">Wines</span>, in respect both to ancient and modern nations.
He drew his proofs from the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia; from the history
of the Egyptian Ptolemies; from the writings of Hermippas, Theophrastus, Clearchus,
Longinus, and even Aristotle, as well as those of Josephus and Philo; from the
public records of France and Great Britain; and from the whole structure of our own
government, and the history of our jurisprudence. He maintained with great force,
that it is to the laws of Moses, and not the politics of Greece and Rome, that we moderns
are indebted for the great and precious principles of civil freedom. He referred to
the fact as not a little remarkable, that when the presidents and professors of our colleges
are most of them ministers of religion, a contrary impression is permitted to remain
upon the minds of the young men, who are there receiving their education to be American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
citizens. He administered a rebuke to those gentlemen, because they do not give
the writings of Moses a more prominent place in their systems of instruction, and
because they do not more distinctly inform their pupils that the true elements of republican
liberty are to be sought in his institutions; but permit the Greek and Roman
authors to monopolize their admiration and their gratitude. The very nations whose
achievements in arts and arms these writers so eloquently commemorate, were not a
little indebted to the genius of the Hebrew legislator for those principles and qualities
in their institutions which awaken our youthful enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In his third lecture, Mr. <span class="smcap">Wines</span> showed that to suppress and supplant idolatry was the
grand design, and constituted, as it were, the very soul, of the Mosaic Institutes. He
entered into an elaborate and erudite examination of the qualities and tendencies of polytheism,
and of the nature, design, and limit of the theocracy. He showed that the theocratic
feature of the government was not an arrangement of the commonwealth, fundamentally
different from the monarchical, aristocratical, democratical, and mixed forms of government;
but that, viewed as to its main design, it was nothing more than a name, or contrivance,
employed the more effectually to exclude idolatry. God took the name of king, as
a title that conferred honor on the Israelites, and the great object of it was to supplant
idolatry, without an infringement of that essential and precious principle of civil liberty,
that mere opinions are not to be cramped and restrained by the pains and penalties of the
civil law. Having cleared the ground by these preliminary disquisitions, the lecturer
entered upon the analysis of the constitution itself. This part of the discussion was exceedingly
novel, philosophical, and luminous. Learned doctors in divinity acknowledged
themselves instructed and charmed by his masterly dissection of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus publicum</i> of the
Hebrews; the texture and frame-work of their government; the fundamental, organic law
of their state. He proved, conclusively, that the government Moses instituted was a constitutional
democracy, and that there were, properly speaking, neither nobles nor peasants
under it, but a brotherhood of hardy and industrious yeomen, all politically equal, and
having each an important stake in the maintenance of public tranquillity and order. The
analogies between the Hebrew government and ours, in their substance, forms, and
modes of administration, were shown to be, many of them, most close and surprising.
The radical features of that ancient and venerable social compact were stated thus:
Each of the twelve tribes formed a separate, and in some respects, independent state,
with a local legislature and supreme court of judicature, having absolute power within
the limit of its reserved rights. Nevertheless, so long as the Constitution of Moses was
preserved unimpaired, there was both a real and a vigorous general government and
national administration. The nation might, with strict propriety, have been denominated,
'The United States' of Israel. The government consisted of four departments; the
chief magistrate, the senate, the oracle, and the congregation of Israel. This last was
the popular branch, and consisted of deputies truly representing the nation, and faithfully
embodying and carrying out the decrees of the popular will. The form of a legal enactment
might have run thus: 'Be it enacted by the Congregation of Israel, the Senate
advising, the Judge presiding, and the Oracle assenting.' There was a supreme national
court at Jerusalem, to which difficult causes were adjourned from the local tribunals.
And, finally, the organization of the tribe of Levi was such as to impart a vital action to
the whole system, at the same time that it served as a sort of counterpoise to the
democracy, and prevented its excesses. All these positions, and many others not here
enumerated, were sustained with an array of convincing arguments, drawn from the
sacred writings themselves.</p>

<p>The great Hebrew statesman foresaw that the time would come, when his countrymen,
infected and dazzled by the example of the surrounding nations, would lose their relish
for republican simplicity, and demand the splendors of a throne and a court. But it was
neither his advice nor his wish that they should have a king. He used every means to
prevent it. He reasoned; he dissuaded; he expostulated; he threatened; he uttered
many solemn and fearful warnings against the dangers and horrors of despotism. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
could not wholly resist the headlong proclivity of his nation to the regal form of government,
he at least postponed the issue which he dreaded; he fenced about the royal
power with a thousand unwelcome restrictions; and, by his glowing and withering
denunciations against every form and species of despotism, he showed how thoroughly
his own spirit was impregnated with popular principles; how deep was his hatred of
tyranny and usurpation; and how ardent and irrepressible his sympathy for the rights,
the liberties, and the happiness of the people. Whoever, then, holds to the divine legation
of Moses, and therefore necessarily believes that a constitutional and representative
democracy is a form of government stamped with the seal of the divine approval, while
the monarchy was but granted in anger to the mad clamors of the people, will hence
derive a new and forcible argument to cherish and defend the precious charter of our own
liberties, since its type and model came originally from the depths of the divine wisdom
and goodness. We are glad to learn that these very able lectures of Professor <span class="smcap">Wines</span>
are to be re-modelled, extended to eight, and repeated the ensuing season. A syllabus
of them lies before us, which we shall have pleasure in presenting, when the time for
their delivery shall have arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> what regularly-progressive steps <span class="smcap">Henry W. Longfellow</span> has trod the path
of fame! We can scarcely call to mind an American writer who has exhibited the
industry of patient acquisition, the increasing refinement of taste, the expansion of fancy,
and the enhanced delicacy of execution, which have distinguished the literary career of
the author of the volume before us. Nor in depth of thought, and power of expression,
have Mr. <span class="smcap">Longfellow's</span> writings fallen behind those of any of his contemporaries;
while in that winning sympathy with humanity, which finds a response in every bosom,
it would be difficult to name his superior. It is not however for this Magazine&mdash;which
has been the source through which the best and most voluminous portions of Mr. <span class="smcap">Longfellow's</span>
poetical writings have been given to the public&mdash;to praise that which our
readers know is its own best commendation. Nor can we, from the scores of pencilled
and dog's-eared pages of the beautiful volume under notice, select a tithe of the passages
which we indicated as we read, rather with the <em>hope</em> than the <em>expectation</em> of being able to
find space for them in our crowded pages. For the beautiful story, we shall, in justice to
the publishers and the author, refer our readers to the volume which contains it and its
accessories, unmutilated; yet in the mean time we cannot resist an extract or two, as a
sample of the execution of the verse. It is enough to 'make lovers of us all,' to read
the annexed dialogue between the enamoured <span class="smcap">Preciosa</span> and <span class="smcap">Victorian</span>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Prec.</span> Dost thou remember when first we met?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Vic.</span> It was at Cordova,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Cathedral garden. Thou wast sitting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the orange-trees, beside a fountain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Prec.</span> 'Twas Easter-Sunday. The full-blossomed trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled all the air with fragrance and with joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priests were singing, and the organ sounded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then anon the great Cathedral bell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the elevation of the Host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We both of us fell down upon our knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the orange boughs, and prayed together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never had been happy, till that moment.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Vic.</span> Thou blessed angel!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Prec.</span> And when thou wast gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt an aching here. I did not speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To any one that day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Vic.</span> Sweet Preciosa!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved thee even then, though I was silent!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Prec.</span> I thought I ne'er should see thy face again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy farewell had to me a sound of sorrow.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Vic.</span> That was the first sound in the song of love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce more than silence is, and yet a sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands of invisible spirits touch the strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that mysterious instrument, the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And play the prelude of our fate. We hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice prophetic, and are not alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If any doubt that <span class="smcap">Wordsworth's</span> 'comfort in the strength of love' can be exaggerated,
let him or her 'inwardly digest' the following picture of the power of this passion,
drawn by <span class="smcap">Victorian</span>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14"><span class="smcap">What</span> I most prize in woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is her affection, not her intellect.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What am I? Why, a pigmy among giants!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if thou lovest&mdash;mark me, I say lovest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest of thy sex excels thee not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world of the affections is thy world&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that of man's ambition. In that stillness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which most becomes a woman, calm and holy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sittest by the fireside of the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeding its flame. The element of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is pure. It cannot change nor hide its nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But burns as brightly in a gypsy camp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a palace hall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How forcible are the following thoughtful lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12"><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> <span class="smcap">Hast</span> thou e'er reflected<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much lies hidden in that one word <em>now</em>?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I oft have thought, my dear Hypolito,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That could we, by some spell of magic, change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world and its inhabitants to stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same attitudes they now are in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fearful glances downward might we cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the hollow chasms of human life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What groups should we behold about the death-bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Putting to shame the group of Niobe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What joyful welcomes, and what sad farewells!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What stony tears in those congealéd eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What visible joy or anguish in those cheeks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What bridal pomps, and what funereal shows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What foes, like gladiators, fierce and struggling!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What lovers with their marble lips together!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But we are admonished of our lack of space; and are left only room to say to every
lover&mdash;whether of some precious maid, or more precious 'wife and mother now,' or
lover only of the beautiful and the true in poetry&mdash;to obtain the 'Spanish Student,' and
lay 'its gentle teachings to the new-warmed heart.'</p>

Institution; Professor B. B. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>, of Andover; and Professor C. C. <span class="smcap">Felton</span>, of Harvard
University. Boston: <span class="smcap">Gould, Kendall, and Lincoln</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> work will be warmly welcomed by scholars, and all true lovers of classical learning.
Professor <span class="smcap">Edwards</span> furnishes an essay upon the study of Greek literature, of
classical antiquity, and upon the school of philology in Holland; President <span class="smcap">Sears</span> presents
the reader with an article upon the schools of German philology, a very voluminous
correspondence between eminent philologists in Germany, together with a history of the
Latin language: and Professor <span class="smcap">Felton</span> contributes an admirable paper upon the Wealth
of the Greeks in Works of Plastic Art; the superiority of the Greek Language in the
use of its Dialects; the education of the Moral Sentiment among the Ancient Greeks;
and, as we have reason, from internal evidence, to believe, the excellent 'Introduction.'
We are glad to learn from this last-mentioned treatise, that amidst the din of practical
interests, the rivalries of commerce, and the great enterprises of the age, classical studies
are gaining ground in public estimation. It is a much more common thing now for young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
men to continue them after leaving college than in former days. 'The excitements of
modern literature lend additional ardor to classical studies. The young blood of modern
literature has put new life into the literature of the dead languages.' <span class="smcap">Goethe's</span> 'Iphigenia,'
<span class="smcap">Talfourd's</span> 'Ion,' <span class="smcap">Milton's</span> 'Samson Agonistes' and its Dorian choruses, and
the creations of the myriad-minded poet of England, are cited, in proof of this position.
In short, the benefits, direct and indirect, of classical study are so forcibly illustrated in
this work, that we hope to see it widely diffused, as an offset against the declamations of
the ignorant&mdash;who undervalue what they do not understand&mdash;against classical acquirements
and sound learning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> well-printed pamphlet before us, as will be seen from its title-page, is merely a
specimen of a larger, and as we infer, yet unfinished attempt. We can hardly believe
however that it will long remain incomplete, if the approving voice of capable judges
shall have weight with the author, to 'whet his purpose.' Although the work must
needs abide a triple test, in a comparison with the original, with previous translations,
and with finished English poems, it is our own belief, and that of others 'whose judgment
cries in the top of ours,' that it will endure the ordeal with honor to the translator.
We regard Mr. <span class="smcap">Parsons's</span> translation as indeed excellent. The versification is melodious
and smooth, and the translator has evidently been scrupulously careful to confine
himself to the exact sense of the original. To the merits of the great creations of
<span class="smcap">Dante</span>, it is of course quite unnecessary to advert; but of the illustrious Italian's claims
to the character of <em>a philosopher</em> it may not be amiss to speak. We glean from a comprehensive
and instructive essay, addressed by the translator to the reader, that <span class="smcap">Dante</span> was
the greatest philosopher of his age. As early as the fourteenth century, he was familiar
with the sphericity of the earth, and alluded to the existence of a western hemisphere.
He was acquainted with the theory of winds, and had a curious insight into the phenomena
of the production of rain. 'He hinted at the laws of gravitation, anticipated
<span class="smcap">Newton's</span> theory of attraction and repulsion, and announced the tendency of the magnet
to the polar star. He anticipated also the discovery of the circulation of the blood; he
described and explained the phenomena of the shooting stars; and long before the telescope
of <span class="smcap">Galileo</span>, he taught us that the milky way was nothing else than the combination
of light with an immense number of smaller orbs.' The fine etching of the bust
of <span class="smcap">Dante</span>, which forms the frontispiece of the pamphlet before us, indicates we think,
beside the other noble characteristics of the poet, this philosophical bent of his mind.
The translator's lines on this bust are admirable. We annex a few forceful stanzas:</p>

<p>We counsel Mr. <span class="smcap">Parsons</span> to pursue the commendable task which he has allotted to
himself, the commencement alone of which redounds so much to the credit of his taste,

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE">EDITOR'S TABLE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Early Writings of the late R. C. Sands: Fourth Notice.</span>&mdash;We resume
a consideration of the early writings of this true son of genius, in a brief review of a
characteristic production of his pen, which we are sorry to say was never completed.
It was the singular biography of '<cite>The Man who Never Laughed</cite>.' It purported to be a
'German story;' but the veil of pretended translation was quite too thin to deceive the
writer's friends, who perused the manuscript. It was entitled '<cite>Tristan, the Grave</cite>.' The
hero was the son of a German Baron in the Duchy of Bremen, in Lower Saxony, 'who
traced his ancestry up to Bruno the First.' Tristan, when an infant, was a comely child,
'perfect in his parts and proportions, with a sober and serene countenance, which seemed
to indicate that he was born to be a great dignitary in the church or in the state. His
lady mother and her attendants soon noticed, however, a strange idiosyncrasy in the
hopes of the family; which was, that he never laughed, nor indeed did his features
assume the faintest appearance of smiling! He could cry, as other babes are wont to do,
and shed as many tears as are usual in the period of childhood; but after the squall was
over, and the cloud cleared away, no sunshine illuminated his face and sparkled in his
eyes. He looked as sedate as a little stone angel on a monument; his lips were as
rigidly fixed; and his gaze expressed but little more intelligence. In vain they tickled
and tousled him; instead of chirruping and smiling, he showed his dissatisfaction at this
appeal to his cutaneous sensibilities, by sneezing and snarling; and if it was prolonged,
by obstreperous lamentation. In vain did the maids snap their fingers, distort their countenances,
and make every variety of grimace and ridiculous posture before him. He
seemed to look upon their monkey tricks with an eye of compassion, and relaxed not a
whit the composed arrangement of his muscles.'</p>

<p>Little Tristan's imperturbable gravity was a great 'thorn in the flesh' of his mother,
who attributed it to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i> of a suspicious-looking old beldame, who hung about
the premises just before he was born, and wrought the unhappy charm upon him. The
old baron, however, treated the subject of his wife's uneasiness with levity, and swore
that when his son was old enough to understand Dutch, <em>he</em> would make him laugh till
his sides ached. The learned Hieronymus Marascallerus, a great astrologer, who superintended
at present the baron's kennel, and was to take charge of his son's education,
when he should arrive at a suitable age, also stoutly denied the agency of any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i>
in the matter; but said that Tristan's sober demeanor was purely the result of natural
causes, he having been born when Saturn and Jupiter were in conjunction in Libra.
His temperament was therefore that of a generous melancholy; but whether he would
make a great poet, or politician, or captain, Marascallerus could not yet decide, as part of
his ephemeris had been eaten by the rats, and he could not adjust the horoscope to his
satisfaction! As Tristan grew up to be a tall boy, and verged to man's estate, the same
utter insensibility to ludicrous exhibitions and associations displayed itself in his physiognomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and character. He was not unsocial in his disposition, but very condescendingly
joined with the younger fry of the village; and in all sports and games where violent
exercise, or that dexterity which is called manual wit was concerned, he was distinguished
for length of wind and ingenuity. When any one of his playmates tumbled
head over heels, broke the bridge of his nose, or put any of his articulations out of joint,
he saw nothing but the detriment done to the body of the suffering individual, and was
incensed by the boisterous and to him inexplicable merriment of the others. He listened
to a droll story as he would to a tragical one; taking an apparent interest in the incidents,
but finding no farther relish in their strange combination, than as they might have
been mere matters of fact. In a bull he saw nothing but the ignorance of the maker;
and he did not detest puns, (if he ever heard any,) because he never suspected the jest.
He heard his father's crack-joke without any other expression than that of wonder, as if
he half thought the old gentleman was crazy.</p>

<p>As he grew in years, <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> was greatly vexed to find that he lacked one of the
common properties of his species, and that his company was by no means considered an
acquisition in jovial society. A face all rosy and radiant with unquenchable laughter,
though like that of one of <span class="smcap">Homer's</span> divinities, was to him like the countenance of a
baboon. He once asked <span class="smcap">Marascallerus</span> whether he supposed any of the heroes, knights,
and kings, recorded in ancient chronicles, ever wrinkled their faces and made hysterical
noises, in the manner of those who were said to be laughing? He had several times
practised before a mirror the detested corrugations which he had noted on the countenances
of others; but on such occasions he succeeded in producing no other expression
than that which a Dutch toy for cracking nuts would wear, without any paint; while his
eyes seemed looking out above, in wonder and scorn at the performance of his lower
features; and he turned with disgust from the image of himself. Time, who travels on
at his jog-trot pace, whether men turn the corners of their mouths upward or downward,
had carried <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> along with him into the twenty-first year of his serious existence;
when his father the baron received a letter from one of his old friends, a brother <span class="smcap">Freiherr</span>,
as nobly descended as himself. The writer stated that he was waxing old, and that the
dearest object of his heart was to establish his only child, the fair <span class="smcap">Cunegunda</span>, comfortably
and according to her rank in the world, before he went out of it; and having
heard much of the wisdom and good qualities of his old friend's son, he was anxious to
effect a union of two illustrious houses. <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> professed himself ready to set forward
on the mission forthwith. Provided with a suitable answer to the epistle which had been
received, and a slenderly-furnished purse, and mounted on the least carrion-like looking
steed the old gentleman's stables could furnish, he set forth. <span class="smcap">Marascallerus</span> stood
by, wiping away his tears with the end of a dirty apron, which he wore at his more servile
occupations, and beseeching his pupil not to go for three days longer, as the planetary
influence was just then most malign to all about commencing a journey. But <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>
put spurs to his wind-galled charger, and in a short time reached the boundary of his
father's domains. Here the beast came to a sudden stand, and exhibited violent symptoms
of oppugnancy to the goadings and buffets he received, by way of encouraging him
to proceed. Thrice did he wheel round, quivering in all his ill-assorted members, as if
under the influence of powerful terror; and thrice did <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> compel him to put his
nose in the direction he wished to take. Then uttering a shrill and melancholy neigh, he
started forward at his wonted miscellaneous gait. The natural curiosity of so grave a
lover, touching the appearance and character of a mistress whom he had never seen, are
forcibly depicted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">All</span> along the road the people at the inns treated him with great respect, taking him for a messenger
intrusted with important secrets and despatches, from the sobriety of his looks and seriousness
of his demeanor. After three days' journey he reached the town of Stade, and after making
a disbursement to the improvement of his outward man, repaired to the residence of Baron
Ehrenfriedersdorf, his father-in-law elect. The baron's dwelling stood in an old part of the town,
and looked a little the worse for wear. Tristan felt a little queerish as he lifted the knocker, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the antiquated and half-ruined gate-way. What sort of a young lady was Cunegunda Ehrenfriedersdorf?
Did she squint? and if so, was the obliquity single, double, or manifold? Had she
a hump? and if so, where located? On her shoulder, or her back; or how was its topography?
Was she subject to nervous spasms? If so, how did the twitchings exhibit themselves? All
down one side of her face, or all over? Intermittently, or all the time? Had she had the smallpox?
If so, were the cicatrices deep or shallow? Was her countenance rivelled by it, into longitudinal
or latitudinal seams, or promiscuously? Was she a natural, or a virago? All these
doubts passed over the mind of the suitor as the iron fell from his fingers. A hollow sound reverberated
from the ruinous establishment, and the portal was opened by a decayed-looking serving-man,
faded alike in years and in his livery. At sight of the grave-looking young man, he bowed
respectfully, taking him for a candidate for holy orders, if not a licentiate, and marshalled him
across the court.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The first thing the grave <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> heard, as he followed the seneschal, was 'an
uproarious peal of laughter from an upper story and a female organ.' The Baron
<span class="smcap">Ehrenfriedersdorf</span> and his family were at the dinner-table; and finishing his third
bottle, he was telling one of his favorite High Dutch stories; at which his guests, as in
duty bound, including his fair daughter, were in a roar of laughter, of that sort which the
little fat schepen died of, as related by <span class="smcap">Diedrich Knickerbocker</span>. An antique figure
of a man, at the right of the baron, with lantern-jaws and a long proboscis of a nose,
tipped with a pair of green goggles, a dubious figure of fun, had a peculiar asthmatic
'<em>Hugh! hugh! hugh!</em>'&mdash;an ancient maiden of sixty or thereabout, sat near him, whose
stiff, starched deportment belied the compulsory '<em>He! he! he!</em>' which issued from her
inward person&mdash;and by <em>her</em> side sat a reverend, round-faced, jolly-looking personage,
from whose rosy gills and oral cavity issued an obstreperous '<em>Ho! ho! ho!</em>' which
seemed to have been fabricated in the inmost recesses of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præcordia</i>. Other nameless,
or from their German patronymics unnameable guests there were, with kindred voices
and physiognomies, who expressed their delight in the same variety of intonation. The
apparition of <span class="smcap">Tristan's</span> wo-begone phiz in the midst of this assembly struck so forcibly
the fair <span class="smcap">Cunegunda's</span> perceptions of the ludicrous, that she burst into a peal of tremendous
cachinnation; while the under-jaw of the baron fell convulsively, as he gazed upon
'the man who couldn't laugh,' and the merry notes of his guests died away into a quaver
of consternation. This was a 'pretty fix' for the melancholy <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>! He was taken
all aback with the beauty of the lovely heiress of <span class="smcap">Ehrenfriedersdorf</span>. Fair, plump,
and just turned of eighteen, she might have served as a model for Hebe. A forehead
smooth and white as Parian marble; arching brows, from beneath which glanced the
fires of two of the brightest eyes that ever sparkled at a merry tale; cheeks tinted with
the rose's deepest dye, and graced by a pair of dimples which seemed the impress of
Love's own fingers; and two ruby lips, whose innocent smile disclosed a row of ivory,
fairer and purer than the pearls which gemmed her bosom, formed a combination of
beauty and expression that would well have become the laughter-loving goddess
Euphrosyne in her happiest moments. <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> made a profound obeisance to the lady,
and endeavored to put a smirk upon his face, which the sage <span class="smcap">Marascallerus</span> had tried
to teach him, and which he had been practising upon the road; but it was such an utter
distortion, that the young lady burst forth into another exorbitant peal of laughter. Being
a comely-looking youth, however, and possessed of a sufficiency of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savor faire</i>, he
soon removed the unpleasant feelings which his ill-timed entrance had produced. He
listened to, although he could not laugh at, the baron's stories; and that was such a novelty
to the old gentleman, that it 'tickled the very cockles of his heart.' The fair <span class="smcap">Cunegunda</span>
began to feel a rising partiality for him: 'If he would only laugh a little, what a
charming youth he would be!' He, on the other hand, could not help exclaiming mentally:
'What a happy mortal I should be, if she didn't laugh so much!' <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>
retires to rest at length, and dreams all night of his beautiful inamorata. In the morning
he is awakened by the beams of the rising sun streaming gloriously through the casement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">He</span> leaned out of the window which looked down upon the baron's garden. It was a lovely
morning in the month of June. The twittering of the swallows on the eaves of the roof, the hum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of thousands of busy insects, the gentle murmur of the morning breeze, as it played among the
leaves of the old elms, and the confused sounds, which, softened by distance, came upon his ear
from the awakening city, produced a soothing effect upon Tristan. Two rosy-cheeked, rugged
urchins were sporting up and down one of the gravel walks, in all the buoyancy and exuberant
spirits of childhood. Every now and then, as some little incident occurred, they gave vent to
their feelings in loud bursts of laughter. The sound grated upon Tristan's ear as he turned from
the window in disgust. 'Why am I thus continually mocked?' exclaimed he, in the bitterness of
his spirit; 'why am I for ever tormented by this strange noise, which I can neither imitate nor
comprehend? Why am I alone of all mankind denied the privilege of throwing the muscles of
my face into that congregation of wrinkles which men call smiling; or of making that incomprehensible
sound to which they give the name of laughter? I can elevate and depress my eyebrows;
I can wink, stare, or squint, with my eyes; I can puff out, and suck in my cheeks; I can
open or pucker up my mouth. Why can't I smile? I can make all manner of noises too. I can
cough. I can whistle, I can sneeze, I can sigh, I can groan; and I can blow the German flute.
Why can't I laugh?' Here the unfortunate young man, in a paroxysm of impatience, gave himself
several severe thumps on his head, as if to inquire why the organ of risibility had been jostled
out of his cranium; and also several plunges in the side with his elbow, as if to know why his
diaphragm would not vibrate spasmodically, like those of other people.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The next evening he accompanies the baron and his daughter to the theatre, to see
'Punch and the Devil.' The audience are ready to die with laughter; but he preserves
the most serene and staid deportment amidst the broad grins, suppressed titters, sudden
guffaws, and obstreperous explosions, by which he is surrounded. He said, it is true,
that it was all very fine, because he heard the others say so; and he joined in encoring
the bravura of '<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich bin der Herr Ponsch!</i>' because <span class="smcap">Cunegunda</span> said she 'would give
the world to hear it again;' but that was the amount of his capability. His unaltered
mien and composed, imperturbable expression, however, were attributed to his good
breeding and polished manners, which prevented him from descending so far from his
dignity. He was accordingly looked up to with increased reverence and admiration by
the more risible plebeians. But alas for <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>! the stream of love does not run more
smoothly in Germany than any where else. A storm was brewing for him. Frau
<span class="smcap">Eickenschnaucker</span> and the venerable <span class="smcap">Grubenhausen</span> propagated a report that he
was under the influence of the <span class="smcap">Evil One</span>! <span class="smcap">Grubenhausen</span> whispered his insinuations,
in confidence, to <span class="smcap">Schwillenaehlen</span>, the red-nosed butler, who hiccupped the
story over his cups, to <span class="smcap">Ohtzenstieler</span>, the ostler, who told it to <span class="smcap">Schnippenbritschen</span>,
the tailor, with the addition, that <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> was followed by a spirit in the shape of a black
dog; <span class="smcap">Schnippenbritschen</span> told the tale to <span class="smcap">Kettelpanschen</span>, the fat landlord opposite
the baron's, where <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> used to take his bitters every morning, and he retailed
it, with various additions, to his customers. Soon nothing was talked of in the town but
'the grave stranger, who was possessed by the <span class="smcap">Old Nick</span>, and couldn't laugh.' As
soon as the baron heard the report of witchcraft, he summoned <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> before him,
bluntly told him his own suspicions, and read him a long lecture on the danger of evil
communications, and concluded by telling him that he 'must learn to laugh like other
folks, or he could be no son-in-law of his.' Poor <span class="smcap">Tristan</span> was astounded. In vain he
expostulated with the baron on the unreasonableness of his demand; and tried to prove
to him that it was undignified to express his satisfaction by twisting up the corners of his
mouth, showing his teeth, and making a strange noise in his throat. In vain the fair
<span class="smcap">Cunegunda</span>, with an imploring look, deprecated her father's anger, and begged him to
let her have a husband, even if he should not be able to speak. Her entreaties were in
vain; and the baron swore with a High Dutch oath, that if he couldn't laugh, he
shouldn't have his daughter. She then turned to <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>, and with a look of love and
a rosy smile, that would have extorted one in return from Heraclitus himself, besought
him to gratify her father by one small snigger. It was all in vain. Threats and entreaties
were equally useless, and <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>, instead of growing pleasanter, became graver and
graver every instant. In order, however, that the unfortunate youth might not complain
of the want of a subject, or an opportunity to display his risible powers, the baron told
him he would give him a fair trial the next day, when he meant to show him such droll
sights, and tell such funny stories, that if he did not split his sides with laughter, the
Devil must have got in him indeed. What the expedients of the baron were, and their
effects upon <span class="smcap">Tristan</span>, <span class="smcap">Sands's</span> patient readers waited long to learn; but their curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was never gratified. Probably the very profusion of ludicrous incidents and situations
which suggested themselves to the fertile imagination of the writer, prevented the fulfillment
of his promise and design. But 'we trifle time' and space. Here endeth the
fourth chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Washington Monument.</span>&mdash;We never write the name of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>,
without a thrill of pride that his country is <em>our</em> country, and that, as an American, we
hold a property in his undying fame. And we are rejoiced to perceive that a National
Monument to this great and good man, a monument worthy his towering name, is at
length to be erected in the great metropolis of America. An act was passed last winter
by the Legislature of New-York, to incorporate the '<span class="smcap">Washington</span> Monument Association;'
and we have been favored with an examination of the design for the magnificent
structure, at the rooms of the architect, Mr. <span class="smcap">Pollard</span>. It is in the form of a pentagon,
and is to be erected of granite, in or fronting on Union-Square; to be finished in the Gothic
style of architecture, richly and elaborately ornamented; with spacious rooms below for
a Historical Library, Gallery for Paintings, etc., approached from the main rotundas.
Its rich Gothic windows, columns, friezes, cornices, and balustrades; its buttresses, turrets,
tower, and pinnacle; partake, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i>, of the sublime in art; and when the
structure shall have towered to its utmost height, the crochet of the pinnacle four hundred
and twenty feet in the air, it will be pronounced the noblest <em>monument</em> in the
known world. It is to be built by the voluntary contributions of the people of the
United States, of <em>one dollar</em> and upward. Some of our wealthy citizens have already
headed subscription-lists with five and ten thousand dollars; and arrangements for the
immediate commencement of the enterprise are now fast maturing. 'May Heaven speed
the good work!' for that monument will rise in honor of one who has 'stamped his
impress on the centuries;' whose virtuous deeds and pure example will only lose their
influence on the country which he loved and whose freedom he won, 'when rolling
years shall cease to move.' If we turn over the pages of history, (says our renowned
progenitor, the immortal <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>) that Man has written of himself, what are the
characters dignified by the appellation of great, and held up to the admiration of posterity?
Tyrants, robbers, conquerors, renowned only for the magnitude of their misdeeds,
and the stupendous wrongs and miseries they have inflicted on mankind; warriors,
who have hired themselves to the trade of blood, not from motives of virtuous
patriotism, nor to protect the injured and defenceless, but merely to gain the vaunted
glory of being adroit and successful in massacreing their fellow beings! What are the
great events that constitute a glorious era? The fall of empires; the desolation of happy
countries; splendid cities smoking in their ruins; the proudest works of art tumbled in
the dust; the shrieks and groans of whole nations ascending unto heaven! How different
the means, how different the results, in the case of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>! Let a recent
orator, an orator worthy his great theme, set forth in appropriate and adequate words
what we would but could not hope to express:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">America</span> has furnished Europe and the world with the character of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>. And if
our institutions had done nothing else, they would have deserved the respect of mankind. <span class="smcap">Washington</span>&mdash;first
in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen&mdash;<span class="smcap">Washington</span> is
all our own. And the veneration and love entertained for him by the people of the United States
are proof that they are worthy of such a countryman. I would cheerfully put the question to-day
to the intelligent men of all Europe&mdash;I will say to the intelligent of the whole world&mdash;what character
of the century stands out in the relief of history, must pure, most respectable, most sublime;
and I doubt not that, by a suffrage approaching to unanimity, the answer would be <span class="smcap">Washington</span>.
That monument itself is not an unfit emblem of his character, by its uprightness, its solidity, its
durability. His public virtues and public principles were as firm and fixed as the earth on which
that structure rests; his personal motives as pure as the serene heavens in which its summit is
lost. But, indeed, it is not an adequate emblem. Towering far above this column that our hands
have built; beheld, not by the citizens of a single city or a single State, but by all the families of
man; ascends the colossal grandeur of the character and life of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>. In all its constituent
parts; in all its acts; in all its toils: in its universal love and admiration, it is an American
production. Born upon our soil; of parents born upon our soil; never having for a single day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
had a sight of the old world; reared amidst our gigantic scenery; instructed, according to the
modes of the time, in the spare but wholesome elementary knowledge which the institutions of
the country furnish for all the children of the people; brought up beneath and penetrated by the
genial influence of American society; partaking our great destiny of labor; partaking and leading
in that acmé of our glory, the War of Independence; partaking and leading in that great victory
of peace, the establishment of the present Constitution; behold him, <span class="smcap">altogether an American</span>!
That glorious life,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Where multitudes of virtues passed along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each pressing foremost in the mighty throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contending to be seen, then making room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For other multitudes which were to come;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">that life in all its purity, in all its elevation, in all its grandeur, was the life of an American citizen.
I claim him&mdash;I claim <span class="smcap">Washington</span>&mdash;wholly for America.'</p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder that 'great cheering'&mdash;that 'enthusiastic,' 'prolonged,' 'deafening,' 'long-continued,'
'renewed' applause&mdash;followed the utterance of these sentences, from the
united voices of a great multitude which no man could number! There swelled the
National Heart; there went up to Heaven the voice of a great People, speaking to Posterity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'<span class="smcap">The Poetry of Life.</span>'&mdash;This volume by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>, author of the 'Women' and
'Wives' of England, savors of professional book-making. Sitting deliberately down to
tell her readers how much poetry may be extracted from the moon, trees, animals, evening,
sound, language, grief, flowers, woman, rural life, and the like, strikes us as a 'dead
set' at the sentimental; and however well the task may be accomplished, it is but bringing
together a confused mass of pleasurable or other emotions, which may not be altogether
common to all the world and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>. In her description of the poetry of the
Bible, she has omitted by far the most prominent exhibitions of that prevalent feature in
the Sacred Word. The sublimity and exquisite beauty which characterize the book of
Job; the unequalled story of Joseph and his Brethren; the touching pathos of <span class="smcap">Paul</span>; it
would not have been amiss, one would think, to have included in a notice of the poetry
of the Bible. In her essay upon the 'Poetry of Language,' Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span> presents the
annexed interesting exhibition of verdancy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> introduction of unpoetical images may be pardoned on the score of inadvertency, but it
is possible for such images to be introduced in a manner which almost insults the feelings of the
reader, by the doggerel or burlesque style which obtains favor with a certain class of readers,
chiefly such as are incapable of appreciating what is beautiful or sublime. One specimen of this
kind will be sufficient. It occurs in a volume of American poetry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">There's</span> music in the dash of waves<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the swift bark cleaves the foam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's music heard upon her deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mariner's song of home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When moon and star-beams smiling meet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At midnight on the sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And there is music once a week</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>In Scudder's balcony.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The moonlight music of the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In storms is heard no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the living lightning mocks the wreck<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At midnight on the shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mariner's song of home has ceased;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His course is on the sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And there is music when it rains</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>In Scudder's balcony.</i>'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'What could induce the poet to spoil his otherwise pretty verses in this manner, it is difficult to
imagine; but as this is by no means a solitary instance of the kind, we are led to suppose that
the minds, in which such incongruities originate must be influenced by the popular notion of imitating
Lord <span class="smcap">Byron</span>, in the wild vagaries which even his genius could scarcely render endurable.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Isn't this rather rich, friend <span class="smcap">Halleck</span>? We doubt whether Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span> could take a
joke, though it were shot at her from a cannon. Indeed, she would doubtless reply to
this remark: 'But how can you shoot a joke out of a cannon? Surely, that can hardly
be feasible!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Gossip with Readers and Correspondents</span>.&mdash;A Friend, writing to us from the City of
Brotherly Love, under date of 'Sixth-month 15th,' respectfully inquires: 'Will the Editor
accept a few remarks on the communication of 'N. S. D.', from a plain Quaker; one, whose
ancestors were Quakers, and who, after a close historical scrutiny, is not ashamed to claim <em>kith</em>,
if he cannot <em>kin</em>, with those of that profession who were hung on Boston Common, or were
beaten at cart-tails from village to village throughout puritanic New-England?' To which we
cheerfully answer: 'Yea, certainly, Friend 'N.' Lift up thy voice against the accuser of the
brethren, and welcome:'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">From</span> the days of <span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span> down to the present time, it has been the constant aim of the defenders
of the reputation of the founders of New England, to cast upon the early Quakers all manner of aspersions.
A few years since, a writer in the 'North-American Review,' having occasion to allude to the
banishment of <span class="smcap">Mary Fisher</span> and <span class="smcap">Anne Austin</span>, the first Quakers who ever visited the western world,
declared that it was for molesting and interrupting ministers in their places of worship. This assertion is
also made by a clergyman of Philadelphia, in a discourse delivered on the anniversary of the landing of the
'Pilgrim Fathers;' with this addition, that one of these women went naked into a place of worship. <span class="smcap">These
charges are not true.</span> I do not believe the reviewer, nor the Doctor of Divinity (so called) wilfully misrepresented
the truth; but I believe them culpable in taking for granted assertions of writers living long posterior
to the events they describe, without examining for themselves the original documents remaining on the
subject. The records of the Massachusetts Colony, as collected by <span class="smcap">Hazard</span>, as well as the narratives published
at the time by the friends of the sufferers, conclusively show that neither <span class="smcap">Mary Fisher</span> nor <span class="smcap">Anne
Austin</span> had ever set foot on the shores of New England until they were taken as prisoners from the vessel in
which they came passengers, and carried to the jail of the colony. Deputy governor <span class="smcap">Bellingham</span> having
received intelligence that two female Quakers were in the ship Swallow, then at anchor in the Bay, commanded
that they should be closely confined therein, and that all their books should be taken from them,
and burned by the hangman. A writer of that day, in reference to the person employed to effect this conflagration,
quaintly remarks: 'O, learned and malicious cruelty!&mdash;as if another man had not been sufficient to
have burnt a few harmless books, who, like their masters, can neither fight, strike, nor quarrel.' At that
time there was no law against Quakers; but the council deemed that they were liable to the penalties of a
law passed in 1646, against heresy and error, which decreed to banishment the opposers of the baptism of
infants, and all such as denied the lawfulness of war. The order of council in this case is now before me,
bearing date 'the 11th of July, 1656.' It commences with enumerating the former laws against heretics, and
goes on to say, that, notwithstanding these, <span class="smcap">Simon Kempthorn</span> had brought in two Quakers, who, on examination,
are found to hold very dangerous and heretical opinions, which they acknowledge they came purposely
to propagate. It directs that the books of the prisoners shall be burned; that the prisoners themselves
shall be kept close, and none admitted to see them without leave from the governor, deputy-governor, or two
magistrates; and that the said <span class="smcap">Simon Kempthorn</span> is hereby enjoined, speedily and directly to transport, or
cause to be transported, the said persons from hence to Barbadoes, from whence they came, he defraying all
the charges of their imprisonment; and for the effectual performance hereof, he is to give security in a bond
of one hundred pounds sterling, and on his refusal to give such security, he is to be committed to prison till
he do it.'</p>

<p>'Of the four individuals put to death at Boston, after examining all the records extant in the respective
cases, the apologies issued by <span class="smcap">John Norton</span> and the 'General Court' of Massachusetts, I am prepared to say,
that there is not the slightest evidence that they were disturbers of the public peace, or violators of public
decorum. The charges brought against them prove indeed that they came to Massachusetts, alleging it was
from a sense of religious duty, and that while there, as free-born citizens of England, they refused a voluntary
submission to laws violating the rights guarantied them by Magna Charta, and the Common Law of
England. I wish not to consume space, but would make a few remarks on the 'frequent occasions' in which
the early Quakers, according to 'N. S. D.', went 'stark naked into the public assemblies.' Women of respectable
connections, easy fortunes, liberal education, and modest demeanor and carriage, for preaching the gospel,
and for merely coming to New-England to look after their rightful possessions, were from time to time stripped
naked to the waist, and whipped from township to township; and yet the nice sense of modesty of the
New-England folk of that day was not shocked. In 1664, when these scenes had been enacted for seven years,
<span class="smcap">Lydia Wardell</span>, who had been summoned repeatedly to appear before the congregation at Newbury, and
whose mind was no doubt under much excitement in sympathy with her fellow-believers in their sufferings,
went into the place of worship in that village, stripped in the manner the magistrates were continually stripping
her friends. The modesty of the people was sorely offended; and seizing her and her female companion,
they stripped the latter, and tying their naked bodies to the whipping-posts, with many lashes
earnestly laid on, endeavored to heal the wounds inflicted on the sense of decorum of the gaping crowd.</p>

<p>'I have not taken up my pen to defend the conduct of <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>, but merely to state the facts of the case.
Beside this instance, one other individual, a few months afterward, under similar excitement, performed a
similar action. Now to our conclusion. These cases, which are the only ones a close examination of the
charges of contemporaneous enemies of the Society, and the defense of its friends exhibit any trace of,
are brought forward at this day in justification of acts of oppression committed long before these occurred;
Turn to the statements forwarded to England to excuse the murder of <span class="smcap">Stevenson</span>, <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, <span class="smcap">Dyer</span>, and <span class="smcap">Leddra</span>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
examine the reasons assigned by <span class="smcap">Norton</span> and the 'General Court' for their proceedings. Their enmity
to the Quakers is strong, but not the slightest hint is given that these suffered because of any indecent exposure,
or that the general persecution the Society at that time endured was occasioned by acts of this or a
kindred nature. And why? Because the first instance of the kind occurred more than three years after the
death of <span class="smcap">Leddra</span>, the last Quaker martyr in New-England. It is a remarkable fact, that soon after these two
cases of voluntary exposure, the public stripping of Quaker women ceased. What effect these had in changing
the feelings of the community, I cannot tell; but it is certainly a curious coincidence, that after this
period the records of courts, and the copious annals of our Society, scarcely exhibit an instance of these cart-tail
indecencies. The rest of the charges of 'N. S. D.' are equally unfounded; and, with sufficient space for
quotations, might be satisfactorily confuted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religious</span> or sectarian controversy is foreign to the purpose of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>; yet we
could not decline the calm consideration of facts brought forward to correct alleged misstatements.
'If,' says the writer, 'N. S. D.' wishes information on a subject with which he seems to
be unacquainted, I should like to refer him to works wherein he may find the original documents.'
For our own part, we think, as we have already partly intimated, that 'the less said the better'
touching the treatment of the Quakers and 'others of the Non-elect' by the New-England Puritans.
<span class="smcap">Washington Irving</span> has driven a long nail home on this theme: 'The zeal of these good
people to maintain their rights and privileges unimpaired, betrayed them into errors, which it is
easier to pardon than defend. Having served a regular apprenticeship in the school of persecution,
it behooved them to show that they had become proficients in the art. They accordingly
employed their leisure hours in banishing, scourging, or hanging, divers heretical Papists, Quakers,
and Anabaptists, for daring to abuse the 'liberty of conscience,' which they now clearly
proved to imply nothing more than that every man should think as he pleased in matters of
religion, <em>provided</em> he thought <em>right</em>; for otherwise it would be giving a latitude to damnable heresies.
Now as they were perfectly convinced that they alone thought right, it consequently followed
that whoever thought differently from them, thought wrong; and whoever thought wrong,
and obstinately persisted in not being convinced and converted, was a flagrant violator of the
inestimable liberty of conscience, and a corrupt and infectious member of the body politic, and
deserved to be lopped off and cast into the fire!' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> are indebted to a most kind correspondent
for the following excerpt from his note-book. It is an extract made many years ago from
some author, whose name and that of his work our friend has alike forgotten. How many just
such thoughtless, rattle-brained, <em>aimless</em> talkers have we encountered! We rather like the practice
of an old friend of ours in this regard! He makes it a point, he says, never to <em>inquire</em> after
any body!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Whoever</span> has visited Cambridge, can hardly fail of recollecting Lady &mdash;&mdash;. The leading idea
of her life was to <em>do the pretty</em>; to say civil things and make agreeable speeches. But alas! her
ladyship was not infallible, and sometimes with the very best intentions would fail desperately.
They relate of her at Cambridge, that during a series of concerts which Madame <span class="smcap">Catalani</span> gave
at the last grand commencement, this Queen of Song was staying at the house of her friend Mrs.
F. At an evening party at D&mdash;&mdash; Lodge, Lady &mdash;&mdash; was invited to meet her. 'My dear Madame
<span class="smcap">Catalani</span>! how delighted, how transported I am to see you! When did you arrive? How
is Monsieur <span class="smcap">Valbrique</span>? and your dear little boy?' <span class="smcap">Catalani</span> changed color; her lip quivered,
and her fine dark eyes filled with tears, as she murmured: '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! pauvre petit, je l'ai perdu!</i>' 'What
an engaging, interesting, elegant little creature he is!' '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je l'ai perdu!</i>' shrieked the foreigner, in
a tone of agony. Lady &mdash;&mdash; had forgot her French. 'Is he, indeed? I am happy to hear it. I
always said he would come out something extraordinary.' '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je l'ai perdu! Je l'ai perdu!</i>' cried
poor <span class="smcap">Catalani</span>, in a more piercing tone, and with increased emotion. 'Don't exert yourself; yes,
yes; I understand you, perfectly; well, pray remember me to him very kindly, since he is not
with you, and offer him my congratulations.' '<em>He is dead! he is dead!</em> Lady &mdash;&mdash;,' said Mrs. F.
impatiently. 'Dead! Why didn't somebody tell me so? Poor little fellow! And so he's
dead! Well, I declare, I am very sorry for him! Dead! That's very surprising!' On another
occasion she said to another distinguished guest: 'Ah! my dear Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span>, what an unexpected
gratification to see you at Cambridge! How d'ye do? Ah! but you are altered, when
one comes to look at you! very much altered! Let me see; it must be thirty years ago since Sir
<span class="smcap">Benjamin</span> and I were first delighted with your Lady Randolph. How life ebbs away! What
changes we see! It was poor <span class="smcap">Edwin's</span> night, I think. Surely, that was the Augustan era of the
British Theatre! Ah! poor <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>! he's gone! And <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, Gentleman <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, he's gone!
And <span class="smcap">Dodd</span>&mdash;clever actor, <span class="smcap">Dodd</span>&mdash;he's gone! We live in a world of changes!' Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span>
looked sad, and was silent. 'I've been recollecting when it was I saw you last. It must be
about fourteen years ago. You played Queen Catherine, and your gifted brother <span class="smcap">John</span> played
Wolsey. What a heat it was! Dear <span class="smcap">John Kemble</span>! and <em>he's</em> gone!' Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span> burst into
tears. 'Amiable creature!' said Lady &mdash;&mdash; to the astonished by-standers; 'what an affectionate
heart she has!'</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> once saw a painting of the <span class="smcap">Saviour of Men</span>, which we could well deem to be like
the divine original; and never while we live shall we forget the heavenly face which the artist had
depicted. It was the countenance of a 'man of sorrows, acquainted with grief:' there was a pervading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<em>pathos</em> in its expression, which 'brought the water-drops to our eyes.' The picture is now
in Germany, where it was painted; and we can never hope to see another so perfect an embodiment
of our conception of the lineaments of the <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>. There was something in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i>
of the picture which we remember to have thought was like a description, by an eye-witness,
of the <span class="smcap">Saviour's</span> personal presence, which we had read in our youth, and which we were glad
recently to encounter in an old common-place book. It was addressed by <span class="smcap">Publius Lentullus</span>,
President in Judea in the reign of <span class="smcap">Tiberius Cæsar</span>, to the Senate of Rome:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Conscript Fathers</span>: There appeared in these our days a man of great virtue, named <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>, who is yet living among us, and of the Gentiles is accepted for a Prophet of truth; but
his own disciples call him the <span class="smcap">Son of God</span>. He raiseth the dead, and cureth all manner of
diseases. A man of stature somewhat tall and comely, and in proportion of body well shaped;
his hands and arms delectable to behold; with a very reverend countenance, such as the beholders
may both love and fear. His hair is of the color of a filbert full ripe to his ears, whence downward
it is more orient of color, somewhat curling or waving about his shoulders. In the midst of
his head, is a seam or partition of his hair, after the manner of the Nazarites. His forehead is
plain and delicate. His cheeks without spot or wrinkle, beautified with a comely red; his nose
and mouth exactly formed. His beard is thick, the color of his hair; not of any great length, but
forked. His look innocent and mature. His eyes gray, dear, and quick. In reproving he is
awful; in admonishing, courteous and friendly; in speaking, very temperate, modest, and wise.
It cannot be remembered that any have seen him laugh, but many have seen him weep. A being
for his singular beauty surpassing the children of men.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> '<cite>Plebeian</cite>' daily journal of Gotham is down upon the <i>Yanokies</i> or Yankees, with a weapon
swung round like a flail; and like another valiant defender of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbockers</span> before him,
he has raised such a buzzing about his unlucky head, that he will need the tough hide of an <span class="smcap">Achilles</span>
or an <span class="smcap">Orlando Furioso</span>, to protect him from their stings. We do not like the <em>nucleus</em> of the
ball which our sturdy democrat has set in motion&mdash;the glorious battle of Bunker-Hill; but for the
rest, we should do dishonor to the spirit of our great historian and sire, if we did not applaud the
prowess which is displayed in this warfare upon a set of 'dieven, schobbejaken, dengenieten,
twist-zoëkeren, loozenschalken, blaes-kaken, kakken-bedden;' a squalling, bundling, guessing,
questioning, swapping, pumpkin-eating, molasses-daubing, shingle-splitting, cider-watering,
horse-jockeying, notion-peddling crew! Let the 'Defender of the Faithful' continue to ply his
trenchant quill: thousands of crowded and jostled <span class="smcap">Knickerbockers</span> are heart and soul in the
contest; and the spirit of <span class="smcap">William the Testy</span>, who was translated to the firmament, and now
forms a very fiery little star somewhere on the left claw of 'the Crab,' looks approvingly down
upon the warfare! We confess that we find it in our hearts greatly to rejoice that the descendants
of <span class="smcap">Habbakuk Nutter</span>, <span class="smcap">Return Strong</span>, <span class="smcap">Zerubbabel Fisk</span>, and <span class="smcap">Determined Cock</span>,
those losel scouts who overreached <span class="smcap">Stoffel Brinkerhoff</span>, are to be taught that the 'sins of the
fathers may be visited upon the children,' by a right valiant son of New-Amsterdam. When we
bethink us how these Yankee varlets penetrated into the New-Netherland settlements, and bored
our taciturn progenitors with their volubility and intolerable inquisitiveness; bringing the honest
burghers to a stand on the highway, and torturing them with questions and guesses; 'and which
is more,' seducing the light affections of the simple damsels from their ponderous Dutch gallants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and introducing among them the ancient practice of <em>bundling</em>; when we call to mind how that
long-sided, raw-boned, hardy race received the proclamations of the sage Governor of New-Amsterdam,
treating them with contempt, and applying them to an unseemly purpose, and foully
dishonoring the valorous <span class="smcap">Van Curlet</span>, who bore them; when we remember these things, and
also how that the tribe has been spreading wider and wider, and growing more impertinent every
day; we cannot find it in our heart to regret that a doughty champion has come out against them,
to expose their braggadocia and annihilate their pretensions. By the beard of <span class="smcap">Mahomet</span>! do they
think that wisdom and patriotism lived alone and is to die with them? Because they are virtuous,
are there to be no more cakes and ale? Is their aspiring metropolis, climbing upon its little hills
to look down upon itself, to eclipse the great capital of the Manhaddoes? Is imperial Rome, in
comparison, to be voted a rat-hole, 'Nineveh,' a nook, Babylon a baby-house, and Pekin the paltriest
pile of the pigmies?' Unanimously, in this meridian, the <span class="smcap">Knickerbockers</span> 'reckon
not!' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> place the following passages from recent letters of two excellent friends in juxtaposition,

from one of the noble bursts of the chorus, I love to sit upon a piazza, with my picturesque head
of hair ensnarled in the breeze, and sing out:</p>

<p>'The strawberries (an old writer has remarked that doubtless <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>might</em> have made a better
berry, but he never <em>did</em>) are as deliriously ripe as if they had been smiled on by Venus, and dear
goddess! she had imbued them with the sweetness of her own lips: '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quinta parte sui nectaris
imbuit.</i>' They are charming! To see them piled up in little heaps, like the fruits of an early
harvest, not to be stored away for a winter of discontent, but to cheer the immediate moment, to
be refreshed every now and then by the anticipation of their sweet breath as it comes up, not
obtrusively, gushing into your face, and causing you to throw back your head with a smile, as if
all the senses were lulled into a dear security! To see them lying in so many wanton attitudes,
as rubicund as if they were intoxicated with sun-beams, in all their variety of shapes; some preciously
diminutive, others of an incredible, jovial plumpness; variegated, luxurious, shaped like
some pyramids I know of, with their great circumference overshadowing the narrow base; conveying
by their very size a provoking, insulting challenge, that they are too big to be swallowed
up&mdash;by Ph&oelig;bus! it is a treat to merge expectation in fruition; and if there is any <em>danger</em> in
swallowing them up, then I say again with Horace: '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulce est periclum</i>'&mdash;the danger is sweet.
'These delights if thou canst give&mdash;&mdash;' Indeed <em>can</em> I; and you shall have others beside&mdash;Και
πλεον εξεις&mdash;as Venus said, when she advertised her missing boy. There is a pleasure in sitting
by the window, to be lulled by a variety of murmurs, or to listen to them in the solemn groves;
whether it be the sound of the sea, or the winds undulating among the tree-tops, or the swarming
of bees, I can hardly tell, they are so like; and if the heart beats at regular intervals not too much
in a hurry or with an inconsiderate knocking, being kept from agitation by a good conscience, as
may without vanity be claimed both by you and me, we shall be captivated by a music more
sweet than <span class="smcap">Bellini</span>. <em>Come out here right off!</em>' Thus far the favored occupant of this delectable
region. Give ear now to that other scholar and gentleman, 'hereinbeforementioned:' '<span class="smcap">It</span> is
truly a blistering day, and the breath from the mouth of the approaching Dog is enough to stifle a
Christian. I keep continually thinking of Nebuchadnezzar's furnace, and repeat, with more
<em>fervor</em> than I could wish, 'Bear me, Pomona, to thy citron shades!' etc. But 'Oh! Jimmy Thompson,
Jimmy Thompson, oh!' never in Green England did you experience such an atmosphere as
this! Pah! it goes down my throat like the spirit of melted lead. Oh! for some water-sprite
to bear me under his dripping wings to the summit of Dawalageri; there among the notched
rocks to sit sipping of iced sherry, and with pine-apples pendant to my very mouth, to whiff the
cool Havana and read <span class="smcap">Dante's</span> Purgatorio! There might some 'swift-winged courier of the
clouds' bring me the July number of the <span class="smcap">Knick.</span>; and after laughing at the wit and melting
with the pathos of American talent, might some prophetic angel unscale my eyes, and show me
in the future the Chinese wall blown up by a match of opium, and the wheels of the Juggernaut
carrying a train of burden-cars and a crowd of travellers from Calcutta to Delhi! What an unimaginable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
world lies behind the vale of that same wonder-pregnant Future! Oh! that one might
raise that veil and see all that is to be, save the destinies of himself and his own beloved land!
The sight, however, might be far from pleasing to the philanthropist. Freedom may fly again to
her hereditary mountains; Knowledge may burn her lonely lamp in conventual cloisters; the
'march of mind' may make a retrograde advancement; another Caliph may fire the Royal Library
of Paris; and posterity may be sufficiently unfortunate to have lost all trace and all memorial of
you and me! God forbid!' * * * <span class="smcap">Repining</span> reader, bethink you in your moments of despondency,

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following, which we derive from a Boston friend, who assures us that it is a 'statement of
a veritable occurrence,' we can very readily believe. Indeed, we have never been able to doubt
any thing which a bird might say, since we heard Uncle <span class="smcap">Bezonnet's</span> 'Poor Mino' in Nassau-street,
laugh, and sing, and exclaim 'Good morning!' 'What's your name?' 'Uncle <span class="smcap">John</span>! Uncle
<span class="smcap">John</span>! somebody's in the store;' and then, changing his tone, remark, what nobody could deny,
'What an extraordinary bird!' But to his 'Boston contemporary:' 'I came across a pious parrot
the other day, while strolling down toward the wharves. It was the first of the class I had
ever seen. I was just passing by a sailor boarding-house, when I heard, several times repeated,
the words, '<em>The Lord ha' massy on Poor Poll, a sinner! Lord ha' massy! Amen!</em>' Turning round,
I perceived they were uttered by a parrot in a cage, who with one claw drawn up on her breast,
head bent reverently down, and eye cocked solemnly upward, was now following her ejaculations
by the most piteous moans. Talking parrots are generally sad creatures, and seldom very
choice in their language. 'But here,' thought I, 'is an exception; and surely, a race which has in
it even <em>one</em> individual capable of attaining to a knowledge of its utterly depraved condition,
cannot be altogether lost.' What seemed to me to be the more remarkable, was the fact that such
knowledge should have been attainable in a sailor boarding-house, in one of the most vicious
streets of the city. While these thoughts were passing through my mind, the parrot had been
eyeing me with an eager, sidelong glance, as if she were quite ready for a chat, and waited only
for me to begin it. 'Pretty, pretty Poll:' said I, stroking her head gently with the end of my
cane; 'Polly have a biscuit?' '<em>Yes, G&mdash;d d&mdash;n you! hand over!</em>' was the sharp, quick
reply.' * * * <span class="smcap">Few</span> and far between, now, are the scenes recorded below by a Southern correspondent.
The last of the old hearts-of-oak will soon fall to the ground: 'Since I last 'drove pen,'
I have sat by the death-bed, watched by the corpse, and shovelled earth upon the coffin, of an old
revolutionary soldier. He served four years in <span class="smcap">Washington's</span> own division of the army; and
doubtless, although he attained no high official rank, his blood was as freely offered, and his services
should be as gratefully appreciated, as those of any general of them all. He was a forgotten
unit in that subaltern rank, on whose individual merits the titled built their edifice of fame. His
offering was like 'the widow's mite,' an offering as dear to him as any the costliest oblation made
unto his country's treasury of glory. Requieseat!' * * * '<span class="smcap">You</span> will find,' says a friend writing
from London, by the last steamer, 'that your portrait has been extensively circulated about Great-Britain
and her dominions, in the last number of 'Chuzzlewit.' The artist who draws the illustrations,
has given, in the person of young <span class="smcap">Martin</span>, who is reading one of your flash newspapers,
in presence of the editor and his war correspondent, a very faithful transcript of the lineaments
of the Editor of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, as we remember them.' We cannot say how far our correspondent
is correct in his impressions; although they were corroborated by a score or more of
American friends, before we had seen the engraving in question; but <em>this</em> we know, that if any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
our readers desire to see a portrait, as life-like as if he had sat for it, of the late lamented <span class="smcap">Willis
Gaylord Clark</span>, they may find it in the person of young <span class="smcap">Martin Chuzzlewit</span>, in the English
edition of Mr. <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> last issue of the work of that name. The outline, the air, the manner,
are <em>perfect</em>. * * * <span class="smcap">It</span> may be thought remarkable, that while to the mass the illusions of the theatre
possess unwonted interest, those who know the most of its secrets affect it the least. <span class="smcap">Theodore
Hook</span>, we are told by his reviewer, had a fixed and rooted aversion to the stage, and a consummate
contempt for the player's profession, as a school of character and manners; an absolute physical
loathing, as it were, for every thing connected with the green-room, from the mouthing art of
managers, to the melancholy pirouettes of the 'poor plastered things with fringes to their stays,
which they call petticoats.' <span class="smcap">Fanny Kemble</span> herself, overcoming so many proud and glorious
associations, did not sicken of it more heartily. Doesn't this militate against the argument of
'C.'? <em>Rather</em>, we think. * * * <span class="smcap">If</span> the reader does not discover something sparkling, quaint, and
decidedly <em>original</em> in '<em>No'th-East by East</em>,' in preceding pages, we shall inevitably have thrown
away and sacrificed 'our guess.' There is a touch of <span class="smcap">Dana</span>, a dash of <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>, and the
'slightest possible taste in the world' of <span class="smcap">Halleck</span>, yet withal no <em>imitation</em>, in that amphibious
poem. Some lines <em>seem</em> somewhat amendable; 'As lightning had sprung <em>sudden</em> then,' is one, for
example. Lightning <em>is</em> rather 'sudden,' we believe, in most cases. We scarcely remember ever
to have seen a <em>very</em> slow flash; yet the line could hardly be bettered, and there is good precedent
for the apparently adscititious word. A few 'common substantives' in the poem may require
elucidation for the uninitiated. The 'Graves' are rocks in Boston harbor, near the outer light, or
'big bright Eye.' Near this light, and past George's island, by 'Nix's Mate,' is the main channel,
through which ships <em>must</em> make a 'procession' in coming up toward Boston. The 'pinkie' is a
schooner-rigged craft, sharp at both ends, a short peak running up aft, and designed for a chasing
sea. The annexed lines were written to follow the passage wherein the courier-star says 'The
sun is coming up this way,' etc., but they came too late for insertion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">The</span> sun is now uncovering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mid-Atlantic&mdash;scattering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mists, with many a toss and fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dangling skirts and weary wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half frantic, as they knew not where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide them from his fiery glare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The iceberg from his ocean-bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifts loftily his glittering head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shakes not off one burnished spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ring in the frosted atmosphere.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> we <em>are</em> amenable to the criticism of our New-Haven friend. Certain it is, however,
that 'the lightness which predominates in our cogitations and gatherings' is often to us a veritable
relief; and if we may trust the candor of many friends, it has been grateful to them also,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">... 'when the fretful stir<br /></span>

<p>We are not all constituted alike, dear Sir; yet what is one man's meat we would not have
another's poison. 'The amiable qualities of cheerfulness and good-humor,' says an old writer,
'cast a kind of sunshine over a composition, and resemble the gentle smile that often lights up the
human countenance, the never-failing indication of a humane temper.' As for wit, we consider
it a species of poetry. It amuses and delights the imagination by those sudden assemblages and
pleasing pictures of things which it creates; and from every common occasion can raise such
striking appearances as throw the most phlegmatic tempers into a convulsion of good-humored
mirth. We fear our censor will consider us 'past mending.' We must still hold with the excellent
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, that 'a little mirth now and then is a great purifier:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Tis mirth that fills the veins with blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than wine, or sleep, or food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let each man keep his heart at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man dies of that disease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that would his body keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From diseases, must not weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whoever laughs and sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never he his body brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into fevers, gouts, or rheums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ling'ringly his lungs consumes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But contented lives for aye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more he laughs, the more he may.'<br /></span>

<p class="noind">Does our critic remember an ancient motto on a sun-dial? '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non numero Horas, nisi serenas?</i>' It
is capable of application. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> are glad to say, since our opinion in this place is requested,
that the essay on '<i>Education of Youthful Morals</i>' is an <em>excellent</em> one. It is only <em>too long</em> for our

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had lately missed our friend Mr. L. P. <span class="smcap">Clover</span>, from his establishment under the Astor-House,
in Vesey-street, and were ignorant of his whereabout; until happening one day to pass
Dr. <span class="smcap">Lyell's</span> church in Anthony-street, near Broadway, we observed, near the door of a building
adjoining that edifice, a couple of large paintings, representing the Falls of Niagara. Entering
to inquire the name of the artist, we opened upon Mr. <span class="smcap">Clover</span>, which 'fully accounted' for the
presence at his door of works of art; for although his establishment is better known for its excellent
looking-glasses and picture-frames, for the sale of which, on reasonable terms, it has become
so popular, yet we have been often indebted to the proprietor's taste and enterprise for the enjoyment
of some of the best paintings to be met at any similar place in the metropolis. To test the
justice of our commendations, let our town readers drop in at Number eighty-three Anthony-street,
and examine <span class="smcap">Vanderlyn's</span> Views of the Great Cataract, and several of <span class="smcap">Ward's</span> fine landscapes.
* * * <span class="smcap">We</span> hear of various changes and some deaths among our contemporaries. Our
friend '<span class="smcap">Sargent's</span> Magazine' has been swallowed up in '<span class="smcap">Graham's</span>;' two or three 'lady-periodicals,'
as they are termed, have been similarly wedded; the 'Southern Literary Messenger,'
since the death of its amiable and persevering proprietor, has been advertised for sale at public
auction; the Charleston 'Magnolia' is we hear to be discontinued: Mr. <span class="smcap">Simms</span> recently transferred
its editorial functions. The 'Orion,' we are informed, will commence its third volume in
September, with increased attractions, literary and pictorial. How many Magazines have arisen,
struggled, and fallen, within the last ten years, that were going to throw the 'Old <span class="smcap">Knick.</span>' into the
back-ground, and darken his out-goings! We could at this moment count up a score of such upon
our fingers; and yet <span class="smcap">Maga</span> 'flourishes in immortal youth!' 'Be virtuous, and you will be happy;'
'Rome was not built in a day;' and so forth. * * * '<span class="smcap">Remember</span> that thou keep holy the Sabbath-Day,'
is a lesson beautifully enforced in the following lines by Sir <span class="smcap">Matthew Hale</span>. We give
them in place of our Baltimore correspondent's remarks upon '<i>Sunday in the Country</i>,' in our last
number:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'A <span class="smcap">Sabbath</span> well spent<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Brings a week of content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And health for the toils of to-morrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But a Sabbath profaned,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whatsoe'er may be gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a certain forerunner of sorrow.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> article upon '<i>President Tyler and his Family</i>' in our last number seems, according to the
newspapers, to have given offence to a portion of the public. The sketch was from the pen of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
old correspondent of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, who had never failed to please its readers; his articles
having always been widely copied and warmly commended. Assured that it had no political
bearing, and that it could in nowise trench upon our neutrality, we gave the paper a place; not
without the thought also that the recent tour of the President and a portion of his family in this
section of the Union would give it additional interest to our readers in the Northern States. The
reception of the article, however, has satisfied us that while politics run high, it is not expedient
for a neutral work like the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> to intermeddle either with public <em>men</em> or public <em>measures</em>.
We shall therefore eschew all kindred themes hereafter. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> are indebted to a kind
friend for the following 'incident of travel.' We have heard before of the couplet which he transcribes,
but never of a <em>serious</em> application of the lines. We did not however need the assurance
of our correspondent that he 'actually saw them, as stated:' 'During a recent journey through
New-Hampshire, with a small party of choice friends, we stopped to refresh ourselves at a little
inn in a village that shall be nameless, although it has a name <em>at home</em>. The parlor into which we
were ushered was ornamented, as is usual in New-England villages, with two or three rude pictures;
and among the rest, the indispensable family mourning-piece. This latter is always irresistibly
attractive to me. Poorly as it is executed, it is the work of love. It speaks of the natural
and holy desire to remember the dead, to hold their images and their memorials near; to bind the
members of the little family, in whatever worlds, together into one. It is one of the many symbols
in which the affectionate heart imbodies its instinctive prophecy of the indissolubleness of the
holy and beautiful alliances of friendship and home. It seems to say: 'We have not yet done
loving the dead. Our sympathies and attachments are too strong to be so soon dissolved. Virtuous
friendship must endure for ever, or love is a cheat. Our holy associations <em>must</em> abide, or we
have no confidence in any thing eternal.' The picture was the work of the needle, representing
with wonderful <em>originality</em> of conception, a weeping willow bending over a small obelisk, upon
which was recorded the name of an infant, aged seven weeks. Beneath the name were the following
lines; the perusal of which, I need not say, produced a most sensible effect upon the feelings
of all the travellers, and left an impression never to be effaced:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Since that I so soon was done for,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder what I was begun for.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The brevity of human life is a mystery, which has often perplexed the wisest heads. But the difficult
question is here propounded 'with a <em>vengeance</em>,' considering the quarter from which it is represented
to have come, that is perfectly overpowering.' * * * <span class="smcap">What</span> an admirable reproof of
selfishness is conveyed in these few words of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>: 'Divide with reason between self-love and
society, and be so true to thyself that thou be not false to others. It is a poor centre of a man's
actions, himself. It is right earth; for that only stands fast upon its own centre, whereas all things
that have affinity with the heavens move upon the centre of another, which they benefit.' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span>
like <em>parts</em> of '<i>The Summer-Storm</i>' very well; but as a whole, it lacks clearness, and in one or two
places the language is tame; mere prose, indeed, and not over-felicitously divided. We can well
<em>imagine</em> the appearance of such a storm, however, in the highlands of Rockland county. <span class="smcap">Thomson</span>
has a spirited picture of a similar scene:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">At</span> first, heard solemn o'er the verge of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest growls; but as it nearer comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolls its awful burthen on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lightnings flash a larger curve, and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise astounds: till over head a sheet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of livid flame discloses wide; then shuts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens wider; shuts and opens still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expansive, wrapping ether in a blaze!'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> one only reason, we decline the 'thrilling story' of 'M. D.' of Hudson. We do not affect
a <em>fight</em> in a tale. Indeed, we crossed out a great battle of fists recently in one of the best articles
that has appeared in the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> for several months. <span class="smcap">Sidney Smith's</span> advice on this
point is most judicious: 'Nobody should suffer his hero to have a black eye, or to be pulled by the
nose. The Iliad would never have come down to these times, if <span class="smcap">Agamemnon</span> had given <span class="smcap">Achilles</span>
a box on the ear. We should have trembled for the Æniad if any Tyrian nobleman had
kicked the pious <span class="smcap">Æneas</span> in the fourth book. <span class="smcap">Æneas</span> may have deserved it, but he never could
have founded the Roman empire after so distressing an accident.' * * * <span class="smcap">Now</span> in this fervid summer
solstice, forget not, O ye sedentary! that most important requirement of the body, frequent
ablution. <em>Bathe! bathe!</em> A recipient ourselves of 'the early and latter rain' of Dr. <span class="smcap">Rabineau's</span>
shower-bath, and eke the benefits of his unrivalled swimming-bath, we speak by the card, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
one having authority. Of Mr. H. <span class="smcap">Rabineau's</span> <em>warm</em> salt water baths, at the foot of Desbrosses-street,
on the North River, we hear also the warmest praises, from the lips of invalids and
others. * * * <span class="smcap">If</span> we were to write a page of fine print in reply to one point of 'S.'s remarks upon
'<i>Street Alms-Giving</i>,' it could not so well express what <em>he</em> at least will understand, as the annexed
brief sentence: 'That charity which Plenty gives to Poverty is human and earthly; but it becomes
divine and heavenly, when Poverty gives to Want.' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> submit it to the reader whether our
correspondent is not excusable for the tardy fulfilment of a promise in which they were interested:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">I've</span> had the tooth-ache, <span class="smcap">Diedrich</span>, and have taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sorts of extracts, essences, and lotions;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have held on blisters, till my jaws were baking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mustard, vinegar, and other notions;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for about a week, at midnight waking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have drank raw fourth-proof brandy, in such portions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Mixed with quinines, valerians, and morphines,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould put a dozen stout men in their coffins.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>'M.'s curt notelet is impertinent and ungentleman-like. His article was a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ébauche</i>, and very
indifferent at that. The <em>nuclei</em> of his associations were objects of the very smallest kind, and the
language was kept down to a sympathetic degradation and due correspondence with the thoughts.
The article was 'respectfully declined,' and in the manner prescribed by its author; and for this
we are berated in no measured terms. 'Go to; you are a fishmonger.' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> '<i>Lines to Old
Ocean</i>' possess a kind of latent rough-and-tumble sublimity, not unlike a good borrowed thought
smothered in windy words by <span class="smcap">John Neal</span>. But we like <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span> prose picture of 'the main'
much better: 'The sea never knows what to do with itself. It hasn't got no employment for its
mind, and is always in a state of vacancy. Like them polar bears in the wild-beast shows, as is
constantly a-nodding their heads from side to side, it never <em>can</em> be quiet.' This is at least '<em>clear</em> to
the meanest capacity.' * * * <span class="smcap">It</span> is said of <span class="smcap">Richter</span>, that his foremost thought about a wife was,
that she should be able to 'cook him something good.' Our Port-Chester epigrammatist seems to
have a taste for the fragile in his estimate of the sex:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Lovely</span> woman's a flower, so when you address her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you wish to retain, I advise you to press her.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The others 'will do.' They bide their time; as also the 'Night on Lake Erie.' * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> recent
death of <span class="smcap">Washington Allston</span>, the painter, the poet, in all respects the man of genius, has left
a void which will not soon be filled; and <em>one</em> there is, in a foreign land, who will feel this sad
event in his very heart of hearts. <span class="smcap">Washington Irving</span> and <span class="smcap">Washington Allston</span> were for
many years friends of as confiding a faith and firm an attachment as <span class="smcap">Damon</span> and <span class="smcap">Pythias</span>. They
rose to fame abroad together; were constant mutual advisers in literature and art; and at one
time, when they were residing temporarily in Rome, we came near losing our renowned author,
through the love he bore his friend, and a desire to unite with him in the common pursuit of his
delightful art. We shall hope to obtain for these pages a tribute from the pen of Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span> to the
memory of his illustrious friend. * * * <span class="smcap">Here</span> is a fact related by an eastern correspondent, that
raises <span class="smcap">Handy Andy's</span> character for truth and veracity greatly in our estimation. It matches the
best blunder recorded by that amusing narrator: 'Not many days since, a little child, two years
old, the son of a poor Irish widow, lay in the middle of a new road, kicking up a dust, and roasting
in the sun. Presently came along an Irish teamster, who in the most deliberate and careless
manner walked his team over the little fellow, and crushed him to death. Some dozen or twenty
Irish shanties were in full view of the catastrophe; and as might be expected, there was a rush
and an ullulloo from a hundred women at once. While some took up the dead body, others
shouted after the teamster, who, apparently unconcerned, was making slowly off. They forced
him back to the scene of the catastrophe, where they did not hesitate to accuse him of having
caused it purposely. Pat of course denied it strenuously, declaring that he did not see the child,
and was therefore wholly blameless. But with a hundred fierce eyes glaring upon him at once,
and fifty tongues hissing in his ear, he became confused, began to waver, and finally gave up the
point entirely, probably as a peace-offering to his tormentors: 'Thrue, thrue, Mistress <span class="smcap">Conolly</span>,'
said he to one of them, while he scratched his head sorrowfully, 'I <em>did</em> see the boy lying there,
'pon me word; <em>but I thought he was asleep!</em>' This, Mr. C., is a positive fact.' * * * <span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever
peruse these '<i>Lines written upon a Watch?</i>' We derive them from a favorite contributor, who
informs us that his honored father, in winding up his watch, used often to repeat them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Could</span> but our tempers move like this machine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not urged by passion, nor delayed by spleen,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But true to Nature's regulative power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By virtuous acts distinguished every hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Health and Joy would follow, as they ought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laws of motion and the laws of thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Health, to pass the present moments o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And endless Joy, when Time shall be no more!'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>'<span class="smcap">One</span> more last word' to '<i>Mein Herr of Albany</i>,' to whom we alluded in our last number. We
admit the justice of your satire; but with deference, it strikes us that it does not require a cimeter
to cut down a gnat. <span class="smcap">Hood</span> somewhere mentions an Irishman who apologized to the keeper of a
menagerie for insulting his elephant by a rude assault upon his most prominent feature. He
couldn't resist, he said, the only chance he had ever had to pull a nose that he could take hold of
with both hands! Our correspondent has a kindred excuse, certainly, in <em>one</em> sense, but not in
another. 'Fleas are not lobsters,' nor are asses elephants. * * * A <span class="smcap">VERY</span> charming story, friend
'G.' of Illinois; simple, well-told, and <em>not too long</em>&mdash;the bane of kindred performances. Love-stories
should <em>end</em> once in a while, by way of novelty. How many novelists have elaborated
chapter after chapter, to depict the true-hearted constancy which is better described in these four
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I <span class="smcap">LO'E</span> nae a laddie but ane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He lo'es nae a lassie but me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's willing to make me his ain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his ain I am willing to be.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>'<span class="smcap">T.'s</span> manuscript is <em>wretched</em>. The words are strung together like a bunch of onions. Some of
the conglomerated syllables reminded us of a sign in London, mentioned by <span class="smcap">Hook</span>, whereby a plain
manufacturer of Roman cement was turned into a manufacturer of <i>Romancement</i>; as if he were
anxious to solicit business from the prolific fashionable novelists of the time. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> do <em>not</em>
accept '<cite>The Signs of the Times</cite>.' The writer looks through a pair of very dark spectacles, we
should say. Going upon the assumption that every man is a rascal until he <em>proves</em> himself an
honest man, would be a course as unjust to a community as to an individual. Our correspondent
seems to think that 'the world is in a state of bankruptcy; that it owes the world more than the
world can pay, and ought to go into chancery and be sold!' The best-laid plans of <em>honest</em> men,
our censor should remember, often fail. The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the
strong, as many a delving, toiling 'two-footed worker' can bear witness:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Dame Fortune</span> is a fickle gipsy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And always blind, and often tipsy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She'll bless you with the sunniest weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestowing honor, pudding, pence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can't imagine why, or whence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in a moment. Presto, pass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hopes are withered like the grass.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have received a very indignant epistle from '<i>The Mail-Robber</i>,' who read our last number at
Saratoga, where he is temporarily sojourning. We shall present it to our readers, with another
poetical epistle, in our September issue. 'Mohawk, a Cluster of Sonnets,' by our friend H. W.
<span class="smcap">Rockwell</span>, Esq.; 'Green places of the City,' by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hewitt</span>; and 'Thoughts at Niagara,' are
in type for our next. A word here to a few correspondents whose articles were not named in the
large list enumerated in our last, or who have not been privately advised of the reception and disposition
of their papers: Where is our venerable friend to whom we have been indebted for '<i>The
Young Englishman?</i>' We look for him in our next. The 'Treatise of Books' by 'R.' struck us
as rather stiltish and labored in its style, although its <em>thoughts</em> were unexceptionable. It was
declined, however, because our port-folios contained three or four papers on the same theme, for
whose insertion at some future day we have been looking for several months. The 'Treatise'
awaits 'R's order at the publication-office. 'H. W. R.'s indignation at the silly charge of plagiarism
of '<i>The Southern Pinewoods</i>' by <span class="smcap">Bryant</span>&mdash;whose lines on '<i>The Prairies</i>,' written for the
<span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, furnished every thought and simile for the imitation&mdash;would be thrown away
upon a 'weak invention.' The whole affair is a stupid joke, not worth a resurrection. 'Chronicles
of the Past,' by an esteemed friend and contributor, is filed for insertion. 'Peter Brown and
Dolly Cross,' a Legendary Ballad, and 'Night and Morning,' by 'W. H. H.,' bide their time. They
are 'booked.' 'T.'s 'Lines on the Death of a Young Girl' are under 'hopeful' advisement. We
shall be glad to receive the 'Inquiry concerning the Manifestation of Mind by the Lower Orders
of Animals.' The theme is a fruitful one. Notices in type, of several new publications, are
<em>unavoidably</em> omitted.</p>

<h2><a name="LITERARY_RECORD" id="LITERARY_RECORD">LITERARY RECORD.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Washington: a National Poem.</span>'&mdash;Who was it contributed five pounds toward the payment
of the English national debt? He was such a benefactor to Britain, in a pecuniary point of
view, as the author of this '<span class="smcap">Washington</span>' poem is to our national literature. To judge from his
high-sounding preface, one would think that <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was to be out-done, and the fame of by-gone
poets utterly eclipsed. The writer went into a 'state of retiracy' and 'threw himself into his
task.' He 'read, mused, and meditated; wrote and re-wrote.' He rose early and reposed late;
'sleepless himself, to give to others sleep!' He 'prepared himself long and laboriously' for his
great effort, and 'laid his foundations deep.' And the result is, that he has given us an <em>original</em>
poem which sets criticism at defiance. In this judgment, unless 'we bedoubt them o'ermuch,'
to use our poet's words, his readers will at least agree with us. Since the 'travail in spirit' of
Dr. <span class="smcap">M'Henry</span>, in bringing forth 'The Antediluvians' in twelve books&mdash;an ominous number in
the present instance also&mdash;we have seen nothing to compare with the pains and perils which our
poet must have suffered and dared, in giving birth to the literary offspring under notice. Our candid
and deliberate advice to the author is, to bottle up Book First in spirits, and strangle its eleven
brothers.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Illustrations of the Croton Aqueduct.</span>'&mdash;We regret that we did not receive this noble
work of Mr. F. B. <span class="smcap">Tower</span>, of the Engineer Department, in time for adequate notice in the present
number. As it is, we cannot forbear to call public attention to its great merits. The volume is a
superb quarto, containing upward of twenty large and exceedingly well-executed engravings,
illustrating all the important structures on the entire line of the Aqueduct, from its source; its tunnels,
aqueducts, bridges, reservoirs, fountains, etc. In the letter-press, which we should not omit
to add does great credit to the care and skill of the printer, Mr. <span class="smcap">Osborn</span>, we find a clear and comprehensive
history of the preliminary measures which led to the accomplishment of this great
enterprise, together with accounts of the aqueducts of ancient Rome, and of the Romans in other
parts of Europe, as well as of the modern Roman, Italian, French, Mexican, and South American
works, of a kindred character. Messrs. <span class="smcap">Wiley and Putnam</span> are the publishers.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Clontarf, or the Field of the Green Banner</span>,' is the title of an Irish Historical
Romance, in verse, by <span class="smcap">John Augustus Shea</span>, which reaches us at too late an hour for adequate
perusal and notice. Not to pass it wholly by, however, we are fain to say, that in hastily reading
a passage here and there through the volume, we have been struck with the warm spirit of freedom
which it breathes, the easy flow of its versification, and its frequently agreeable imagery and
faithful pictures of passion. The poetical introduction is fervid and felicitous. A few minor
poems, which have acquired general celebrity, among them that fine address to the ocean, 'Likeness
of Heaven!' etc., close the volume; which being published by <span class="smcap">Appleton and Company</span> is
of course in good keeping in its externals.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The North-American Review</span>, for the July quarter, is an excellent issue of that always
respectable Quarterly. The leading paper, upon the life and character of <span class="smcap">Thomas Paine</span>, is
written with great power, and with evident familiarity with all the details of the history of its
notorious subject. <span class="smcap">Stephens's</span> 'Travels in Yucatan' and Miss <span class="smcap">Bremer's</span> novels are noticed in
terms of well-deserved praise. These, with an entertaining and instructive article upon the cod,
mackerel, and herring fisheries, are all which we have found leisure to read. The remaining
papers are upon the 'Mutiny of the Somers,' <span class="smcap">Drake's</span> 'Northern Lakes and Southern Invalids,'
'The School and the School-master,' 'The Nestorian Christians,' 'Classical Studies,' and the
usual briefer 'Critical Notices.'</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Nisbet's Lecture.</span>&mdash;We have perused the lecture delivered before the Georgia Historical
Society at Savannah, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Eugenius A. Nisbet</span>, with satisfaction and pleasure. The
writer's remarks upon the drama; the tendency of French literature; the necessity of an international
copy-right law; the intellectual inheritance which we have derived from England; and the
influence of domestic airs and national songs; are exceedingly forcible and just. We commend
especially Mr. <span class="smcap">Nisbet's</span> argument in favor of literary protection to those liberal-minded casuists
who would at the same time pick an author's brains and his pockets, and defend the justice of the
operation, on the ground that the victim could not help it, and that <em>somebody</em> would rob him if <em>they</em>
did not!</p>
